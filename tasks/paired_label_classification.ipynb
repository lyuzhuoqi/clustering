Upon lens removal, IPE cells of the dorsal iris transdifferentiate to lens cells and eventually form a new lens in about a month 2,3. This property of regeneration is never exhibited by the ventral iris cells. The regeneration potential of the iris cells can be studied by making transplants of the in vitro cultured IPE cells. For the culture, the dorsal and ventral iris cells are first isolated from the eye and cultured separately for a time period of 2 weeks (Figure 1). These cultured cells are reaggregated and implanted back to the newt eye. Past studies have shown that the dorsal reaggregate maintains its lens forming capacity whereas the ventral aggregate does not form a lens, recapitulating, thus the in vivo process (Figure 2) 4,5. This system of determining regeneration potential of dorsal and ventral iris cells is very useful in studying the role of genes and proteins involved in lens regeneration.',\n",

Preprocedural mouthrinses or chemotherapeutic coolants are used for the reduction of bacterial load in dental aerosols. The use of chlorhexidine as an ultrasonic coolant has been well established. However, this application has not yet been investigated for cinnamon extract which is known to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. Aim: The aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine and cinnamon extract as an ultrasonic coolant in reduction of aerosol contamination and biofilm formation during ultrasonic scaling in comparison with the distilled water (DW). Materials and Methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe gingivitis were randomly divided into three groups of twenty patients each undergoing ultrasonic scaling. For Group I, chlorhexidine was used as an ultrasonic coolant; for Group II, cinnamon extract was used; and Group III was served as control where DW was used. The aerosols from ultrasonic units were collected on two blood agar plates at three different positions. Both the plates from each position were incubated aerobically for 48 h. The total number of colony-forming units were counted as mean ± standard deviation and statistically analyzed. In addition, biofilm sampling of dental unit waterlines (DUWLs) was also done to evaluate the effect of these antimicrobials. Apart from microbial examination, clinical parameters such as plaque index and gingival index were also evaluated at baseline and 1-month follow-up. Results: Chlorhexidine and cinnamon both were equally effective (P > 0.05) in reducing the bacterial count in aerosols and biofilm in DUWL as compared to DW when used as ultrasonic cooling agent. Conclusion: Both cinnamon and chlorhexidine used as an ultrasonic device coolant through DUWLs effectively helped in the reduction of bacterial count in dental aerosols.',\n",

However, some physiological (mitosis) and pathological (oxidative stress) processes may switch the classic mechanism to an alternative one that is regulated by an mRNA element such as IRES, uORF, IRE, CPE, DICE, AURE or CITE. A recently discovered mechanism of RNA hypoxia response element (rHRE)-dependent translation initiation, may change the view of oxygen-regulated translation and give a new insight into unexplained biochemical processes. Hypoxia is one of the better-known factors that may trigger an alternative mechanism of the translation initiation. Temporal events of oxygen deficiency within tissues and organs may activate processes such as angiogenesis, myogenesis, regeneration, wound healing, and may promote an adaptive response in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, growth of solid tumors may be accompanied by cyclic hypoxia, allowing for synthesis of proteins required for further progression of cancer cells.

Methods   In patients implanted with the NeuroPace® RNS® System, acute changes in iEEG spectral power following active and sham stimulation periods were quantified and compared within individual iEEG channels. Additionally, acute stimulation-induced acute iEEG changes were compared within iEEG channels before and after patients experienced substantial reductions in clinical seizure frequency.       Results   Responsive stimulation resulted in a 20.7% relative decrease in spectral power in the 2–4 second window following active stimulation, compared to sham stimulation. On several detection channels, the AERS features changed when clinical outcomes improved but were relatively stable otherwise. AERS change direction associated with clinical improvement was generally consistent within detection channels.       Conclusions   In this retrospective analysis, patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy treated with direct brain-responsive neurostimulation showed an acute stimulation related reduction in iEEG spectral power that was associated with reductions in clinical seizure frequency.

In the state of Ceara, its cultivation is performed mainly by family farms who make use of traditional varieties of good adaptation to the growing region. Thus, characterizing traditional varieties with characteristics of adaptation to regions with water shortage is essential for the production of food in the world, especially in semi-arid regions. In this sense, the objective was to evaluate the physiological and biochemical responses in three genotypes of cowpea, being two traditional varieties grown in Ceara (Sempre-Verde and Cabeca-de-Gato) and a genotype characterized as a standard of drought tolerance (Pingo-de-Ouro-1,2) under three water regimes: irrigated, moderate deficit and severe water deficit. The parameters evaluated were: gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, organic solutes (proline, total carbohydrates, reducing and non-reducing carbohydrates), starch and enzyme activity (APX, G-POD, CAT and SOD). The genotype Pingo-de-Ouro-1,2 confirmed its tolerance pattern in a water deficit condition, presenting greater water potential, higher photosynthetic rate, high levels of total carbohydrates and high accumulation of proline. Among the traditional varieties, the Cabeca-de-Gato presented superior photosynthesis to Sempre-Verde higher Electron Transport Rate (ETR), reflecting in a greater photochemical quenching (qP) and a greater accumulation of proline, indicating that this variety presents more pronounced adaptive characteristics for water restriction conditions, which is a common condition to the Brazilian semiarid.',\n",

MAs and their biosynthetic intermediate, nicotianamine (NA), are also important for the translocation of divalent metals such as Fe and zinc (Zn) throughout the plant body. In this study, the physiological role of the efflux transporter EFFLUX TRANSPORTER OF NA (ENA1), which exports NA out of cells, was analyzed in rice. Promoter-GUS analysis showed that ENA1 was mainly expressed in roots, and strongly upregulated under Fe-deficient conditions. In epidermal onion cells and rice roots, green fluorescent protein-tagged ENA1 localized mainly to the plasma membrane, while a part of the fluorescence was observed in vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. In the younger stage after germination, ENA1-overexpressing rice plants exhibited truncated roots with many root hairs compared to wild-type plants, while these phenotype were not observed in high Zn-containing medium. In Arabidopsis, which use a different strategy for Fe uptake from rice, ENA1 overexpression did not show any apparent phenotypes. Oligo DNA microarray analysis in rice showed that ENA1 knockout affects the response to stress, especially in root plastids. These results suggest that ENA1 might be recycling between the plasma membrane and cellular compartments by vesicular transport, playing an important role in the transport of NA, which is important for the physiological response to Fe deficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The AURKA gene, encoding Aurora kinase-A (Aurora-A), is frequently amplified and overexpressed across multiple cancer types correlating with poor prognosis. Although the AURKA gene is frequently amplified in human cancers, underlying mechanism(s) for Aurora-A protein stability through different phases of cell cycle are not well elucidated. Inhibiting the kinase activity and promoting protein degradation are two well-validated conceptual strategies for targeting protein kinases in cancers. Here, we demonstrate that Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 Alpha 2 (eEF1A2) facilitates PTEN-GSK3β mediated Aurora-A protein degradation through the SCF complex (SKP1-Cul1-FBXW7) during the S/G2 phase of proliferating cells. In contrast, this mechanism is inactivated in cancer cells accompanying PTEN-GSK3β pathway deficiency. Mechanistically, eEF1A2 interacts with Aurora-A, GSK3β, FBXW7 and Cul1-E3 ligase, as the SCF complex, to facilitate Aurora-A polyubiquitination for 26S proteasomal degradation. eEF1A2 promotes PTEN phosphorylation at T366 and stability, inactivates AKT and activates GSK3β which in turn phosphorylates Aurora-A at S283, S284 and S342. The phosphorylation of Aurora-A at S342 is detected during S/G2 phase of cell mitosis in parallel with eEF1A2-SCF complex formation with active form of GSK3β and neddylated Cul1. Conversely, genetic ablation of EEF1A2 and PTEN, activation of AKT, inhibition of GSK3β, expression of Aurora-A phosphodeficient-mutant attenuates the Aurora-A protein degradation which is corroborated in Aurora-A overexpressing mouse mammary carcinomas and human breast carcinomas. This study identifies a novel mechanism of Aurora-A protein degradation mediated eEF1A2-PTEN-GSK3β pathway and provides a framework for the discovery of Aurora-A therapeutic targets in breast cancer that harbors deficiency of PTEN tumor suppressor pathway.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Introduction   Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Lifestyle, environmental effects and several genetic factors have been proposed to contribute to its development. Though the majority of PD cases do not have a family history of disease, genetic alterations are proposed to be present in 60 percent of the more common sporadic cases.       Objective   The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of PD related specific risk variants of LRRK2, MAPT, SNCA and PARK10 genes in the Hungarian population. Out of the ten investigated polymorphisms three are proposed to have protective effect and seven are putative risk factors.       Methods   For genotyping, TaqMan allelic discrimination and restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used. LRRK2 mutations were investigated among 124 sporadic PD patients and 128 healthy controls. MAPT and SNCA variant frequencies were evaluated in a group of 123 patients and 122 controls, while PARK10 variant was studied in groups of 121 patients and 113 controls.       Results   No significant difference could be detected in the frequencies of the investigated MAPT and PARK10 variants between the studied Hungarian PD cases and controls. The minor allele of the risk factor S1647T LRRK2 variant was found to be more frequent among healthy male individuals compared to patients. Moreover, in the frequency of one of the investigated SNCA variant a significant intergroup difference was detected. The minor allele (A) of rs356186 is proposed to be protective against developing the disease. In accord with data obtained in other populations, the AA genotype was significantly more frequent among Hungarian healthy controls compared to patients. Similarly, a significant difference in genotype distribution was also found in comparison of patients with late onset disease to healthy controls, which was due to the higher frequency of AG genotype among patients.       Conclusion   The frequencies of different gene variants show great differences in populations. Assessment of the frequency of variants of PD related genes variants is important in order to uncover the pathomechanisms underlying the disease, and to identify potential therapeutic targets. This is the first comprehensive study focusing on these genetic variants in the population of East-Central European region. Our results extend the knowledge on the world wide occurrence of these polymorphisms by demonstrating the occurrence of specific alleles and absence of others in Hungarian PD patients.',\n",

The conservation and restoration of mangroves are expected to play an important role in mitigating climate change, and understanding the factors influencing mangrove stem growth and wood production are important in predicting and improving mangrove carbon sequestration and responses to environmental change. In this study, we collected data of individual diameter at breast height (DBH) growth rate and stand level aboveground wood production in both non-plantation (commonly termed as natural) mangroves and mangrove plantations across the world. Climatic factors, proxies of edaphic factors, as well as biological factors (e.g. mangrove species) were included as explanatory variables in the analyses to determine factors influencing the global patterns of tree growth rate and stand wood production of mangroves. Using hierarchical Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis we found interactions among environmental and biological factors in controlling mangrove tree growth rate and stand wood production. We also found different global patterns of tree growth rate and stand wood production between non-plantation mangroves and plantations. Climatic conditions (precipitation of driest season, precipitation seasonality) were the most important factors influencing the global pattern of tree DBH growth rate in non-plantation mangroves, with edaphic and biological characteristics also playing a role under specific climatic conditions. The global pattern of stand wood production in non-plantation mangroves was primarily determined by stand mean DBH growth rate of individual trees. However, in mangrove plantations management measures, specifically species selection and planting density, were the most important factors influencing the global patterns of tree growth rate and stand wood production. Our study provides parameters for a global estimation of long-term carbon sequestration in both non-plantation mangroves and mangrove plantations. In addition, our results help us better predict the dynamics of tree growth and carbon sequestration of non-plantation mangroves under changing climate.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ochratoxin A (OTA) occurrence in cereals is a permanent challenge in human health. In recent years, some studies have focused on the role of yeasts as adsorbing tools to eliminate OTA. The aim of the current research was to study the effects of different variables including Saccharomyces cerevisiae amount and the fermentation temperature on the reduction of OTA during bread baking. For this purpose, the OTA was spiked to the flour and then the bread was prepared. OTA levels in flour, dough, and bread were measured by the high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FD). The results revealed that yeast level and fermentation temperature had a significant effect on OTA reduction. The increase of the amount of S. cerevisiae from 1 to 2 w/w and the fermentation temperature from 25oC to 30oC resulted in the increment of OTA reduction from 31.17 to 59.41. During baking, OTA reduction was 19.21. In general, the utilization of 2 w/w S. cerevisiae and the fermentation temperature of 35 oC could reduce considerable amount of OTA in the wheat bread. © 2019 The Authors.

A fundamental and important problem on DTRSs operating in multiple environments is how to determine the threshold parameter pairs based on loss functions. In this paper, we establish a theoretic and systematic framework for the optimization of the threshold parameters in DTRSs. A general optimization-based approach is developed to determine the threshold pair for DTRSs with various semantics. First, with the aid of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) condition, we propose two optimization models and prove that these models are mathematically equivalent to previous DTRS models. Second, the proposed models are extended to new models using intervals, triangular fuzzy numbers, and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers of loss functions. We discuss the relations among these loss functions based on nonlinear ranking approaches to fuzzy numbers. Third, three types of extended optimization models for three fuzzy environments are constructed, and the uniqueness of their optimal solutions is analyzed and proven. In addition, we utilize optimization techniques to search for their optimal solutions and to determine the threshold pairs. Finally, an example and related comparisons are presented to show the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.',\n",

Some single-event characteristics are easily applicable when obtaining site indexes, however, they are overly generic to consider all the above-mentioned aspects, and the more specific indices present the inconvenience of calculation parameters that are dependent on the equipment type, which makes them more adequate to quantify the impact of voltage sags on certain loads rather than to evaluate the sites’ performance. In this context, the proposed methodology aims to obtain a single set of calculation parameters that is applicable to all cases, allowing large-scale assessments. For this purpose, a statistical approach is adopted, considering the correlation between the index and the number of equipment trips, in order to define the adjustment most correlated with the sensitivity level of different types of loads. The Impact Factor is used as a basis in determining the desired index. A case study illustrates the application of the proposed methodology, showing how these aspects can be addressed from a better definition of the Impact Factor.',\n",

Multiple reports exist supporting the potential of the approach in proteomic biomarker validation.

The retrieved studies were further filtered to focus on disease biomarkers and the main results are summarized. Expert opinion: MRM is increasingly employed for the quantification of both well-established but also newly discovered putative biomarkers and occasionally their post-translationally modified forms in plasma. Fractionation is regularly required for the detection of low abundance proteins. Standardized procedures to facilitate assay establishment and marker quantification have been proposed and, in few cases, implemented. Nevertheless, in most cases, absolute quantification is not performed. To advance, multiple technical issues including the regular use of standard labeled peptides and appropriate quality controls to monitor assay performance should be considered.

The nonreciprocity of microwave transmission in interference stop bands characterized by change in the transmission coefficient T at the inversion of H has been revealed. Nonreciprocity increases at the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance near a band. In this case, a jump of T by two orders of magnitude to a level of a passband is observed with the reversal of the magnetic field H. The sign of nonreciprocity depends on the relative position of ferromagnetic resonance and the stop band and can change at a small variation of the magnitude of H.

Aunque se ha descrito que los puntos de acupuntura tienen propiedades electricas diferentes a las de las zonas adyacentes, como son una alta conductancia y una baja impedancia, los mecanismos subyacentes son completamente desconocidos. En este estudio se investigo, utilizando un modelo de ratas hipertensas, si la alta conductancia presente en los puntos de acupuntura era el resultado de la liberacion de los neuropeptidos sustancia P (SP) y del peptido relacionado con el gen de la calcitonina (CGRP) durante la inflamacion neurogenica en el area de dolor referida. Para ello se utilizo un electrodo de nueva construccion, la inyeccion intravenosa de colorante azul de Evans (EBD) y una serie de grabaciones termicas e imagenes cutaneas. Al examinar la extravasacion de plasma producida por la inflamacion neurogenica puesta en evidencia por la perdida del EBD, se vio que esta era mayor en los puntos de acupuntura de la muneca. El aumento de la conductancia y la temperatura en estos puntos de acupuntura se produjo durante el desarrollo de la hipertension. El aumento de la conductancia y la extravasacion de plasma en los puntos de acupuntura en ratas hipertensas se eliminaron cortando los nervios mediano y cubital, bloqueando las fibras aferentes de diametro pequeno de los nervios mediano y cubital, mediante la inyeccion de resiniferatoxina (RTX), o antagonizando los receptores de SP o CGRP en los puntos de acupuntura. A su vez, la inyeccion intradermica de SP o CGRP produjo un aumento de la conductancia y la extravasacion de plasma en ratas sin manipular (naive). Se encontraron niveles elevados de SP y CGRP en los puntos de acupuntura de ratas hipertensas. Estos hallazgos sugieren que la alta conductancia en los puntos de acupuntura se debe a la extravasacion vascular que tiene lugar tras la liberacion local de SP y CGRP producida durante la inflamacion neurogenica.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Hardware transactional memory is a new parallel programming paradigm supported by current commercial multiprocessors. This paradigm provides optimistic concurrency and overcomes some of the problems associated with classical lock-based synchronization, such as deadlock and serialization. Certain algorithms of computational geometry are found to be good candidates for parallelization with this paradigm. However, hardware transactional approaches to these algorithms lead to poor performance as the resulting transactions are too large for the underlying hardware to deal with. Large transactions overflow hardware resources serializing the execution.   In this paper, we propose using privatizing transactions to parallelize two computational geometry algorithms: Lee’s algorithm, which solves the shortest-route problem, and Ruppert’s algorithm for Delaunay/Voronoi mesh refinement. Privatizing transactions are based on commercial hardware transactional memory extensions, and their goal is to reduce transaction footprint by means of a non-transactional private execution section. This results in effective smaller transactions. Our implementation is able to further reduce the transaction size as we propose a reduced validation set for privatizing transactions. Programming complexity of these implementations is discussed.   Results show that our privatizing transaction implementations indeed enhance performance comparing with existing hardware transactional memory versions. Experiments with Intel’s transactional memory extensions yield speedups ranging from 2     ×       to 3.5     ×       with four threads.',\n",

The PI3K/Akt-associated proteins were quantified by Western blot in terms of phosphorylation and total expression. Results indicate that the acute administration of DPIN induced time-dependent phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and its related substrates within the hypothalamus, indicating an activation of the insulin signaling pathway. This profile is consistent with DPIN as an insulin sensitizer since we also found a decrease in the circulating concentration of this hormone. Overall, the present study shows the pharmacological action of DPIN in the hypothalamus through the PI3K/Akt pathway when giving in fasted animals.

Due to the low reaction temperature and N2-free reaction atmosphere, the property of low NOx emission was found in the early days of the technology's development. In CLP, oxygen carriers (OCs) can also remove tar through catalytic cracking, remove pollutants containing S/Cl by reacting with S/Cl to form metal compounds, and promote the conversion of Hg0 to Hg2+ through catalytic oxidation to promote subsequent removal of Hg. Recent advances in the removal of tar- and nitrogen-, sulfur-, chlorine- and mercury-containing pollutants in CLP are reviewed in this paper. On the basis of these findings, the effects of various oxygen carriers, additives and reaction conditions on the removal of various pollutants are discussed. Due to its environmental friendliness and low price, Fe-based OCs, especially Fe-rich natural ores and solid wastes, are the most promising for practical application. It is hoped that the synergistic removal of pollution can be achieved by loading a Cl/S absorbent and active metal oxides on OCs.\",\n",

It is spread through bites from infected ticks, animal husbandry and can also be acquired in the healthcare setting during care of infected patients. In humans, CCHFV can cause a sudden onset of a non-specific febrile illness that can rapidly progress to severe hemorrhagic manifestations. Currently, there is no widely available vaccine and although ribavirin has been suggested for the treatment of CCHFV, clinical efficacy in both animal models and humans is inconsistent suggesting more potent antivirals are needed for CCHFV. Favipiravir is approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza virus infections and has shown promise against other highly pathogenic RNA viruses including CCHFV with demonstrated efficacy in the type I interferon deficient mouse model. In this report we utilized the cynomolgus macaque model to evaluate the efficacy of once- and twice-daily favipiravir treatment against CCHFV infection. We found that favipiravir treatment suppressed viremia and viral shedding when treatment was initiated 24\\xa0h post-infection and viral burdens in key tissues trended lower in favipiravir-treated animals.

Further, people with diabetes are at increased risk for severe Covid-19 disease. Our goal was to examine the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms related to the Covid-19 pandemic in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).   Psychosocial surveys were sent to 3,653 adults with T1D from the Adult Clinic at the Barbara Davis Center. Survey responses were collected from 899 adults from this population between September and October of 2020; 65% of respondents were women, and the age range was 18-95 years.   Overall, 5% of participants reported testing positive for the virus or having Covid-19 symptoms but not being tested. As shown in the table, overall 49% of adults reported depressive symptoms and 74% reported experiencing anxiety related to Covid-19. Women with T1D were more likely to report Covid-19 related depression and anxiety symptoms, despite similar infection rates in both sexes. Further, women were more likely than men to express concerns about obtaining diabetes care and paying for diabetes supplies during the pandemic.   The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in adults with T1D, particularly among women. These data suggest a potential area for intervention to improve psychosocial health.   Disclosure   E. Malecha: None. K. A. Driscoll: None. V.

Integrating full-duplex transmission into cooperative spectrum sharing systems results in two intrinsic problems: 1) the residual loop interference occurs between the transmit and the receive antennas at the secondary relays and 2) the primary users simultaneously suffer interference from the secondary source (     $\\\\textsf {SS}$     ) and the secondary relays (     $\\\\textsf {SR}\\\\text{s}$     ).

To do so, we derive and quantitatively compare the lower bounds on the outage probability and the corresponding asymptotic outage probability for max–min relay selection, partial relay selection, and maximum interference relay selection policies in frequency selective fading channels. To facilitate comparison, we provide the corresponding analysis for half-duplex. Our results show two complementary regions, named as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) dominant region and the residual loop interference dominant region, where the multipath diversity and spatial diversity can be achievable only in the SNR dominant region, however the diversity gain collapses to zero in the residual loop interference dominant region.',\n",

However, the involvement of CAs in chemical-induced carcinogenesis is unclear. In the current study, we aimed to clarify the possible involvement of CAs in chemical carcinogenesis using a rat model with the non-mutagenic hepatocarcinogen acetamide. In an in vivo micronucleus (MN) test, acetamide was revealed to induce CAs specifically in rat liver at carcinogenic doses. Acetamide also induced centromere-positive large MN (LMN) in hepatocytes. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses of the LMN, which can be histopathologically detected as basophilic cytoplasmic inclusion, revealed abnormal expression of nuclear envelope proteins, increased heterochromatinization, and massive DNA damage. These molecular pathological features in LMN progressed with acetamide exposure in a time-dependent manner, implying that LMN formation can lead to chromosome rearrangements. Overall, these data suggested that CAs induced by acetamide play a pivotal role in acetamide-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats and that CAs can cause chemical carcinogenesis in animals via MN formation.',\n",

CASE PRESENTATION A 4-year-old girl, weighing 13.5\\xa0kg, was diagnosed with bilateral congenital renal hypodysplasia, urogenital sinus and anorectal malformation. The patient was referred to our department for living-donor KT. Her mother was eligible as a donor, presenting a body weight ratio of 1:4.5. Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (ICV) was also identified, without any predisposing factor for thrombophilia. KT was performed by an extraperitoneal approach without complications. Venous anastomosis required a human vascular graft sutured to the ICV, and renal artery was anastomosed to the aorta. On postoperative day (POD) 8, acute abdominal pain and hematuria led to the diagnosis of an allograft venous thrombosis. An emergent laparotomy was required to explant the allograft, followed by bench surgery. The allograft was irrigated with thrombolytic agents and lactated Ringer's solution and then after removing the venous vascular graft, it was reimplanted through vascular anastomosis with the ICV and aorta. The recovery of perfusion and function was good with diuresis since day 4 after re-surgery.

Chemical analysis, optical microscopy, hardness test and friction wear test were conducted to study the effects of heat treatment on hardness of the drill collar 4145H and the casing 30Mn5V, and discuss the relationship between hardness and wear resistance of them. The results showed that the materials of drill collar and casing after different heat treatment had varying degrees of wear, both of the respective wear amounts were gradually increasing with the increase of hardness of them, the wear extent of casing material was greater than that of drill collar material. The hardness of casing material was the lowest and its wear resistance was the best when quenching at 880°C and tempering at 630°C. And when quenching at 900°C and tempering at 690°C, the hardness of drill collar material was the lowest and its wear resistance was the best. Therefore, the hardness of drill collar and casing can be improved by changing the heat treatment process to improve the wear resistance, thereby reducing the wear conditions between them.',\n",

Most questionnaires generally accepted in clinical practice are available in English and need to be appropriately adapted in translation and undergo subsequent validation before they can be used in another culture and language. MATERIAL AND METHODS The process of translation of the questionnaires was based on the generally accepted guidelines of the International Quality of Life Assessment Project (IQOLA). First, the questionnaires were translated from English into Polish by two independent translators. Then, a joint version of the translation was prepared collectively and translated back into English. Each stage was followed by a written report. The translated questionnaires were then evaluated by a group of patients. We selected 31 patients with wrist problems and asked them to complete the PRWE, Mayo, Michigan and DASH questionnaires twice at intervals of 3-10 days. The results were submitted for statistical analysis. RESULTS We found a statistically significant (p<0.05) correlation for the two completions of the questionnaires. A comparison of the PRWE and Mayo questionnaires with the DASH questionnaire also showed a statistically significant correlation (p<0.05). CONCLUSION Our results indicate that the cultural adaptation of the translated questionnaires was successful and that the questionnaires may be used in clinical practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one of the curative treatment options for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, the outcomes in patients transplanted without complete remission (non-CR) have not yet been fully reported, and detailed analyses are required to identify subgroups in which optimal prognosis is expected and to optimize pre-transplant therapeutic strategies. Hence, we performed a multicentred retrospective cohort study including a total of 663 adult ALL patients transplanted at non-CR status; the median bone marrow (BM) blast counts at HSCT was 13·2%, and 203 patients (30·6%) were treated at primary induction failure status. The overall survival (OS) was 31·1% at two years, and the multivariate analyses identified five prognostic risk factors, including older age (≥50 years), increased BM blasts (≥10%), poor performance status, high haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)-comorbidity index, and relapsed disease status, among which BM blast was the most significantly related. A predictive scoring system composed of these risk factors clearly stratified OS (15·6-59·5% at two years). In conclusion, this is the first large-scale study to analyze the correlation of patient characteristics with post-transplant prognosis in ALL transplanted at non-CR status. The importance of blast control before HSCT should be focused on for better patient prognosis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Summary   Background   Respiratory complications are an important cause of postoperative morbidity. We aimed to investigate whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) administered immediately after major abdominal surgery could prevent postoperative morbidity.   Methods   PRISM was an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial done at 70 hospitals across six countries. Patients aged 50 years or older who were undergoing elective major open abdominal surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive CPAP within 4 h of the end of surgery or usual postoperative care. Patients were randomly assigned using a computer-generated minimisation algorithm with inbuilt concealment. The primary outcome was a composite of pneumonia, endotracheal re-intubation, or death within 30 days after randomisation, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received CPAP. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN56012545.   Findings   Between Feb 8, 2016, and Nov 11, 2019, 4806 patients were randomly assigned (2405 to the CPAP group and 2401 to the usual care group), of whom 4793 were included in the primary analysis (2396 in the CPAP group and 2397 in the usual care group). 195 (8·1%) of 2396 patients in the CPAP group and 197 (8·2%) of 2397 patients in the usual care group met the composite primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1·01 [95% CI 0·81–1·24]; p=0·95). 200 (8·9%) of 2241 patients in the CPAP group had adverse events. The most common adverse events were claustrophobia (78 [3·5%] of 2241 patients), oronasal dryness (43 [1·9%]), excessive air leak (36 [1·6%]), vomiting (26 [1·2%]), and pain (24 [1·1%]). There were two serious adverse events: one patient had significant hearing loss and one patient had obstruction of their venous catheter caused by a CPAP hood, which resulted in transient haemodynamic instability.   Interpretation   In this large clinical effectiveness trial, CPAP did not reduce the incidence of pneumonia, endotracheal re-intubation, or death after major abdominal surgery. Although CPAP has an important role in the treatment of respiratory failure after surgery, routine use of prophylactic post-operative CPAP is not recommended.

The construction method of freezing pipe roof and five-bench fourteen-step excavation is expected to be adopted, which is the first case in the world. The tunnel construction risk is great because the stratum which the tunnel passes through is mainly silt and the construction procedure is complex. In addition, the load-transfer mechanisms in tunnelling construction are not clear. In this paper, the field test method and numerical simulation were utilized to study the development and distribution of ground deformation and support deformation during the construction of Gongbei tunnel, and the mechanical responses of tunnel support structure in the tunnelling construction were investigated. The results showed that the ground deformation was uplifted with the excavation of the tunnel due to the freezing and grouting of the surrounding rock. The vault deformation during the excavation process was fluctuating due to Gongbei tunnel was excavated in several steps, which was generally in the state of settlement first and then heave. The peripheral convergence around the tunnel increased first and then tended to be stable with the excavation progress. The removal of temporary support had a slight impact on the convergence around the step C. Due to the existence of the pipe roof and freezing soil, the tunnel supporting stress was small, which ensure the safety of the tunnel structure. Stress results of steel frame of initial support showed that the vault and invert bent to the inside of the tunnel, and the side wall bent to the outside of the tunnel. The bending moment of the secondary lining was larger than that of the initial support due to the ring forming of the secondary lining separately, and the secondary lining might be damaged locally. After the temporary support was removed, the overall stress of the initial support and secondary lining increased slightly. The stress concentration of the secondary lining was relieved after thawing. The interface stress between secondary lining and tertiary lining was large. This case study might severe as a practical reference for similar tunnelling constructions.',\n",

It identifies an opportunity space that can be leveraged for urban and broader transitions to sustainability on the continent by leveraging “economic ecosystems” for local scale social innovation-based development interventions. It theorizes that multi-level transitions to sustainability can be engendered by adopting an entrepreneurial state led approach at local scales by using economic ecosystems as the framework to (1) stimulate social innovation-based entrepreneurship that meets local and local–regional demands through decentralized, low cost, small-scale infrastructures, technologies and services, (2) leverage social innovation-based economic ecosystems for catalyzing multi-scalar transitions to sustainability, (3) recast the role of the entrepreneurial state, specifically in relation to social innovation and sustainable urban development (SUD) in Africa and (4) bridge formal–informal sector dualism.

Furthermore, few proteomic or peptidomic analyses of these factors have been performed. In this study, the molecular adaptation of high-altitude Odorrana andersonii and cavernicolous O. wuchuanensis to elevated UV radiation was investigated. Compared with O. wuchuanensis, O. andersonii exhibited greater diversity and free radical scavenging potentiality of skin antioxidant peptides to cope with UV radiation. This implied that O. andersonii evolved a much more complicated and powerful skin antioxidant peptide system to survive high-altitude UV levels.

       "  'abstract': 'Duckweeds are a group of monocotyledonous aquatic plants in the Araceae superfamily, represented by 37 species divided into five genera. Duckweeds are the fastest growing flowering plants and are distributed around the globe; moreover, these plants have multiple applications, including biomass production, wastewater remediation, and making pharmaceutical proteins. Dotted duckweed (Landoltia punctata), the sole species in genus Landoltia, is one of the most resilient duckweed species. The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) encodes the RNA components of ribosomes and represents a significant part of plant genomes but has not been comprehensively studied in duckweeds. Here, we characterized the 5S rDNA genes in L. punctata by cloning and sequencing 25 PCR fragments containing the 5S rDNA repeats. No length variation was detected in the 5S rDNA gene sequence, whereas the nontranscribed spacer (NTS) varied from 151 to 524 bp. The NTS variants were grouped into two major classes, which differed both in nucleotide sequence and the type and arrangement of the spacer subrepeats. The dominant class I NTS, with a characteristic 12-bp TC-rich sequence present in 3-18 copies, was classified into four subclasses, whereas the minor class II NTS, with shorter, 9-bp nucleotide repeats, was represented by two identical sequences. In addition to these diverse subrepeats, class I and class II NTSs differed in their representation of cis-elements and the patterns of predicted G-quadruplex structures, which may influence the transcription of the 5S rDNA. Similar to related duckweed species in the genus Spirodela, L. punctata has a relatively low rDNA copy number, but in contrast to Spirodela and the majority of other plants, the arrangement of the 5S rDNA units demonstrated an unusual, heterogeneous pattern in L. punctata, as revealed by analyzing clones containing double 5S rDNA neighboring units. Our findings may further stimulate the research on the evolution of the plant rDNA and discussion of the molecular forces driving homogenization of rDNA repeats in concerted evolution.',\n",

Most industrial AD applications, carry excessive heating costs, however, as AD reactors are commonly operated at mesophilic temperatures while handling waste streams discharged at ambient or cold temperatures. Consequently, low-temperature AD represents a cost-effective strategy for wastewater treatment. The comparative investigation of key microbial groups underpinning laboratory-scale AD bioreactors operated at 37, 15 and 7°C was carried out. Community structure was monitored using 16S rRNA clone libraries, while abundance of the most prominent methanogens was investigated using qPCR. In addition, metaproteomics was employed to access the microbial functions carried out in situ. While δ-Proteobacteria were prevalent at 37°C, their abundance decreased dramatically at lower temperatures with inverse trends observed for Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Methanobacteriales and Methanosaeta were predominant at all temperatures investigated while Methanomicrobiales abundance increased at 15°C compared to 37 and 7°C. Changes in operating temperature resulted in the differential expression of proteins involved in methanogenesis, which was found to occur in all bioreactors, as corroborated by bioreactors' performance. This study demonstrated the value of employing a polyphasic approach to address microbial community dynamics and highlighted the functional redundancy of AD microbiomes.\",\n",

We explored and compared the influences of achievement approach goals from the old and new achievement motivation models (Elliot & McGregor, 2001; Elliot, Murayama, & Pekrun, 2011) on online students’ help-seeking through intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. Path analyses were used to test two models of help-seeking among college students from four online educational psychology classes (N = 93) based on the two models of achievement goals. Our results showed that the new 3 × 2 model was a better fit than the old 2 × 2 model, suggesting that the achievement approach goals of the new model differ from those of the old model conceptually as Elliot, Murayama, and Pekrun (2011) posited. Second, our results revealed both unexpected direct and indirect positive influence of performance- and other-approach goals on online students’ help-seeking behaviour through extrinsic motivation. Third, while mastery-approach goals indirectly predicted help-seeking through intrinsic motivation, self- and task-approach predicted help-seeking in a dramatically different manner. Self-approach goals displayed indirect influence on help-seeking through intrinsic motivation similar to mastery-approach, yet task-approach displayed a negative direct influence on help-seeking. These results suggested the potential positive impact of self-approach and the detrimental influence of task-approach goals on help-seeking in e-learning environment.

The fibers were deposited onto non-woven spunbond polypropylene (SPP) and the basis weight (grammage, g/m2) was varied to assess the resulting effect on filtration efficiency and breathing resistance of the materials. The results indicated that a basis weight in excess of 0.4 g/m2 of PAN electrospun fibers yielded a filtration efficiency over 97%, with breathing resistance values that increased proportionally with the amount of basis weight added. With the aim of retaining filter efficiency whilst lowering breathing resistance, the basis weight of 0.4 g/m2 and 0.8 g/m2 of PAN electrospun fibers were strategically split up and stacked with SPP in different configurations. The results suggested that a symmetric structure based on SPP/PAN/PAN/SPP was the optimal structure, as it reduces SPP consumption while maintaining an FFP2-type of filtration efficiency, while reducing breathing resistance, specially at high air flow rates, such as those mimicking FFP2 exhalation conditions. The incorporation of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles within the electrospun nanofibers in the form of nanocomposites, retained the high filtration characteristics of the unfilled filter, while exhibiting a strong bactericidal capacity, even after short contact times. This study demonstrates the potential of using the symmetric splitting of the PAN nanofibers layer as a somewhat more efficient configuration in the design of filters for respirators.',\n",

Additionally, Chinese English bilinguals prefer vertical gestures to lateral gestures when perceiving Chinese time references with vertical spatial metaphors and the corresponding English translations, whereas there is no such preference when perceiving time references without spatial metaphors. Furthermore, this vertical tendency is not due to the fact that vertical gestures are generally less ambiguous than lateral gestures for addressees.

The smallest zonal inventory along the I03 line among the three lines was primarily due to a sampling bias, because the I03 line in the Indian Ocean was along 20°S, which is more equatorward than the other two lines along approximately 30°S in the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. The I03 line in the Indian Ocean had the smallest zonal inventory of bomb-produced   14 C and the largest of bomb-produced   137 Cs, suggesting that the distribution of bomb   14 C in the Indian Ocean is determined primarily by the thermocline ventilation within the Indian Ocean. The history of bomb   14 C over time suggests that the bomb   14 C inventory in the southern subtropical regions increased steadily up to the early 1990s. The rate of increase then slowed between the early 1990s and 2003/2004 because of a decrease in the bomb   14 C influx from the atmosphere to the surface ocean. The highest bomb   14 C inventory among the southern subtropical regions was in the subtropical Indian Ocean. However, the contribution of the Indonesian throughflow from the North Pacific and Indian Oceans to this large inventory in the Indian Ocean is not clear. The   14 C data along the BEAGLE2003 lines in 2003/2004 were compared with those obtained during WHP in the 1990s and during the South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment in the late 1980s. The zonal averages of the decadal changes in   14 C revealed that bomb   14 C continued to increase between the late 1980s/1990s and 2003/2004 in the southern subtropical regions of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, an increase in the natural   14 C as a result of circulation changes also contributed to the apparent decadal increase of the bomb   14 C. All of our results suggest that the distribution of bomb   14 C in the Southern Hemisphere is governed primarily by thermocline ventilation processes within the Southern Hemisphere.',\n",

Aim   To investigate penile prosthesis infection microbiology to consider which changes in practice could decrease infection rates, to evaluate current antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, and to develop a proposed algorithm for penile prosthesis infections.       Methods   This retrospective institutional review board–exempt multi-institutional study from 25 centers reviewed intraoperative cultures obtained at explantation or Mulcahy salvage of infected three-piece inflatable penile prostheses (IPPs). Antibiotic usage was recorded at implantation, admission for infection, and explantation or salvage surgery. Cultures were obtained from purulent material in the implant space and from the biofilm on the device.       Main Outcome Measures   Intraoperative culture data from infected IPPs.       Results   Two hundred twenty-seven intraoperative cultures (2002–2016) were obtained at salvage or explantation. No culture growth occurred in 33% of cases and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were found in 73% and 39% of positive cultures, respectively. Candida species (11.1%), anaerobes (10.5%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (9.2%) constituted nearly one third of 153 positive cultures. Multi-organism infections occurred in 25% of positive cultures. Antibiotic regimens at initial implantation were generally consistent with American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines. However, the micro-organisms identified in this study were covered by these guidelines in only 62% to 86% of cases. Antibiotic selection at admissions for infection and salvage or explantation varied widely compared with those at IPP implantation.       Conclusion   This study documents a high incidence of anaerobic, Candida, and methicillin-resistant S aureus infections. In addition, approximately one third of infected penile prosthesis cases had negative cultures. Micro-organisms identified in this study were not covered by the AUA and EAU antibiotic guidelines in at least 14% to 38% of cases. These findings suggest broadening antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines and creating a management algorithm for IPP infections might lower infection rates and improve salvage success.

Previous neuroimaging studies have shown a relationship between reading recovery and increases in contralesional and perilesional activation during word reading tasks, relative to controls. Questions remain about how to interpret these changes in activation. Do these changes reflect functional take-over, a reorganization of functions in the damaged brain? Or do they reveal compensatory masquerade or the use of alternative neural pathways to reading that are available in both patients and controls? We address these questions by studying a single individual, CH, who has made a partial recovery of reading familiar words following stroke. We use an fMRI analysis technique, representational similarity analysis (RSA), which allows us to decode cognitive function from distributed patterns of neural activity. Relative to controls, we find that CH shows a shift from visual to orthographic processing in contralesional regions, with a marginally significant result in perilesional regions as well. This pattern supports a contralesional reorganization of orthographic processing following stroke. More generally, these analyses demonstrate how powerful RSA can be for mapping the neural plasticity of language function.',\n",

The evolutionary advantage of this hypercoagulability may be to counteract the inherent instability associated with hemochorial placentation, which is unique to human beings. However, overall, there is a four- to 10-fold increased thrombotic risk throughout gestation and the postpartum period. Certain inherited or acquired thrombophilic factors may predispose to arterial and/or venous thrombosis and have a possible association with pregnancy complications, including recurrent miscarriage (RM), which affects up to 5% of couples with childbearing desire. A subgroup of women with RM has been demonstrated to be in a prothombotic state before and after pregnancy. The long-term health implications of this hypercoagulability may imply an increased risk of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies rather than thrombophilic genetic defects (i.e., factor V Leiden or prothrombin G202010A mutation) in patients with RM is a determinant of thrombotic events later in life, especially among those patients having also cardiovascular risk factors. This article highlights the thromboembolic risk in nonpregnant RM patients in different thrombophilic settings and the need for thromboprophylaxis among these patients.',\n",

The identity of the genes and their interactions that are responsible for establishing this homeostatic state (ie, canalization) remain unknown. We hypothesize that these inbred strains, whose interindividual differences in bone structure and material properties mimic that observed among humans, achieve functional homeostasis by differentially adjusting key molecular pathways regulating external bone size and mineralization throughout growth. The cortices of A/J and C57BL/6J male mouse femora were phenotyped and gene expression levels were assessed across growth (ie, ages 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 weeks). A difference in total cross-sectional area (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) and cortical tissue mineral density were apparent between mouse strains by age 2 weeks and maintained at adulthood (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). These phenotypic dissimilarities corresponded to gene expression level differences among key regulatory pathways throughout growth. A/J mice had a 1.55- to 7.65-fold greater expression among genes inhibitory to Wnt pathway induction, whereas genes involved in cortical mineralization were largely upregulated 1.50- to 3.77-fold to compensate for their narrow diaphysis. Additionally, both mouse strains showed an upregulation among Wnt pathway antagonists corresponding to the onset of adult ambulation (ie, increased physiological loads). This contrasts with other studies showing an increase in Wnt pathway activation after functionally isolated, experimental in vivo loading regimens. A/J and C57BL/6J long bones provide a model to develop a systems-based approach to identify individual genes and the gene-gene interactions that contribute to trait differences between the strains while being involved in the process by which these traits are coordinately adjusted to establish similar levels of mechanical function, thus providing insight into the process of canalization. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.',\n",

Methods   Specimens of fresh dissected human masseter muscle were used to observe the ultrastructural changes that occurred at 6 and 12 months following BoNTA injection.   Results   The findings observed were muscle fiber distortion, sarcomere shortening, mitochondrial vacuolar degeneration, glycogen accumulation, and H and M band disruption in the triad of tubules. At 12 months after injection, there was still evidence of degenerative changes in muscle ultrastructure, whereas most organelles exhibited a normal structure.

The competition for light has been particularly well studied, both for its fitness consequences as well as the adaptive behaviors that plants display to win the battle for light interception. Aboveground, plants detect their competitors through photosensory cues, notably the red:far-red light ratio (R:FR). The R:FR is a very reliable indicator of future competition as it decreases in a plant-specific manner through red light absorption for photosynthesis and is sensed with the phytochrome photoreceptors. In addition, also blue light depletion is perceived for neighbor detection. As a response to these light signals plants display a suite of phenotypic traits defined as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). The SAS helps to position the photosynthesizing leaves in the higher zones of a canopy where light conditions are more favorable. In this review we will discuss the physiological control mechanisms through which the photosensory signals are transduced into the adaptive phenotypic responses that make up the SAS. Using this mechanistic knowledge as a starting point, we will discuss how the SAS functions in the context of the complex multi-facetted environments, which plants usually grow in.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'DNA methylation is an important epigenetic phenomenon that plays a key role in the regulation of expression. Most of the studies on the topic of methylation’s role in cancer mechanisms include analyses based on differential methylation, with the integration of expression information as supporting evidence. In the present study, we sought to identify methylation-driven patterns by also integrating protein-protein interaction information. We performed integrative analyses of DNA methylation, expression, SNP and copy number data on paired samples from six different cancer types. As a result, we found that genes that show a methylation change larger than 32.2% may influence cancer-related genes via fewer interaction steps and with much higher percentages compared with genes showing a methylation change less than 32.2%. Additionally, we investigated whether there were shared cancer mechanisms among different cancer types. Specifically, five cancer types shared a change in AGTR1 and IGF1 genes, which implies that there may be similar underlying disease mechanisms among these cancers. Additionally, when the focus was placed on distinctly altered genes within each cancer type, we identified various cancer-specific genes that are also supported in the literature and may play crucial roles as therapeutic targets. Overall, our novel graph-based approach for identifying methylation-driven patterns will improve our understanding of the effects of methylation on cancer progression and lead to improved knowledge of cancer etiology.',\n",

Comparing to that for CH4 absorbed on (001) surfaces, the frontier energy state was found to the key factor in controlling the adsorption behavior, which is mainly contributed by oxygen and Zr ions of the B-site. The most favorite adsorption site for CH4 was located at B-sites of BaZrO3, where the A-site ions would adjust the charge of B-site ions and moreover affect the CH4 adsorption.

       "  'abstract': \"Spike timing is thought to play a critical role in neural computation and communication. Methods for adjusting spike timing are therefore of great interest to researchers and clinicians alike. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a noninvasive technique that uses weak electric fields to manipulate brain activity. Early results have suggested that this technique can improve subjects' behavioral performance on a wide range of tasks and ameliorate some clinical conditions. Nevertheless, considerable skepticism remains about its efficacy, especially because the electric fields reaching the brain during tES are small, whereas the likelihood of indirect effects is large. Our understanding of its effects in humans is largely based on extrapolations from simple model systems and indirect measures of neural activity. As a result, fundamental questions remain about whether and how tES can influence neuronal activity in the human brain. Here, we demonstrate that tES, as typically applied to humans, affects the firing patterns of individual neurons in alert nonhuman primates, which are the best available animal model for the human brain. Specifically, tES consistently influences the timing, but not the rate, of spiking activity within the targeted brain region. Such effects are frequency- and location-specific and can reach deep brain structures; control experiments show that they cannot be explained by sensory stimulation or other indirect influences. These data thus provide a strong mechanistic rationale for the use of tES in humans and will help guide the development of future tES applications.\",\n",

Formation rates of 5\\u2009nm particles (J5) were found to be correlated positively with the H2SO4 proxy (log J5 versus log[H2SO4] slope near 1) in both local and regional events. Furthermore, J5 was enhanced by the anthropogenic volatile organic carbon (VOC) plumes from nearby industrial area in the local events compared to the regional events. Size-dependent aerosol dynamics calculation showed that in comparison with the observed regional events, the local events were featured with high nucleation rate (J1.3\\u2009>\\u20091000\\u2009cm−3\\u2009s−1), high growth rate of sub-3\\u2009nm particles (GRsub-3\\u2009>\\u200920\\u2009nm\\u2009h−1), and high number concentration of nucleation mode particles (mean peak N5-20: 6\\u2009×\\u2009104\\u2009cm−3).

It further is predictive for poor outcome.Overexpression of Ran has been reported in glioblastoma [GBM] tissue. To further evaluate the role of the Ran signaling pathway in astrocytoma, we measured the expression of its key components Ran, RCC1, RANBP1 and RANBP2 in different types of brain tumor tissue.Materials and Methods:Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis the gene and protein expression was analyzed in 80 tissue samples. The tissue subtypes were astrocytomas WHO II°, anaplastic astrocytomas, primary and secondary glioblastomas and tissue samples after recurrence subsequent to radiochemotherapy. Peritumoral brain tissue was used as a control. For PCR analysis at least 10 glioma probes and for Western blot analysis at least 6 glioma probes were used per group.Results:Ran protein overexpression compared to non-neoplastic brain was detected in anaplastic astrocytomas (90%), primary glioblastoma (140%) and secondary glioblastoma (170%). With increasing WHO grade there was an increase of Ran mRNA expression and chemo-radiation therapy led to further enhanced expression in primary and secondary glioblastoma (from 1.36 to 2.25 and from 2.08 to 3.08 arbitrary unites [AU], respectively). There was also an increase in gene expression of RCC1, RANBP1 and RANBP2 analogue to that of Ran: showing a steady increase with higher WHO grading. Correspondingly to Ran, gene expression of RCC1 increased in primary and secondary glioblastoma recurrent after radiochemotherapy from 3.19 to 3.87 AU and from 4.14 to 10.11 AU respectively as well as that of RANBP2 from 2.36 to 5.14 AU and from 2.77 to 4.74 AU respectively.Discussion:Our data clearly show a grade dependent upregulation of key components of the Ran pathway in astrocytomas and a further increase after radiochemotherapy. Therefore, this pathway may represent a future target for glioblastoma therapy.',\n",

Most previous studies on the unsaturated flow and its influence on slope stability were based on the single-phase water flow model (i.e., the Richards Equation) or the water-air two-phase flow model. The effects of gas transport and soil deformation on the movement of groundwater and the evolution of slope stability were less examined with a coupled solid-water-air model. In this paper, a numerical model was established based on the principles of the continuum mechanics and the averaging approach of the mixture theory and implemented in an FEM code for analysis of the coupled deformation, water flow and gas transport in porous media. The proposed model and the computer code were validated by the Liakopoulos drainage test over a sand column, and the significant effect of the lateral air boundary condition on the draining process of water was discussed. On this basis, the coupled processes of groundwater flow, gas transport and soil deformation in a homogeneous soil slope under a long heavy rainfall were simulated with the proposed three-phase model, and the numerical results revealed the remarkable delaying effects of gas transport and soil deformation on the propagation of the wetting front and the evolution of the slope stability. The results may provide a helpful reference for hazard assessment and control of rainfall-induced landslides.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nickel deposited on carbon has been used as adsorbent to recover Zn (II) from aqueous system. The adsorbent was synthesized by depositing nickel nitrate on carbon under inert conditions and decomposing it to nickel by raising the temperature, washing and vacuum drying. Various techniques including XRD, FTIR, and SEM were employed for its characterization. FTIR showed that the nickel deposition enhanced the carbon functionalization due to presence of OH, C=O and C-O groups.Average crystallite size ofabout 9 nm was determined from XRD. Nickel deposition resulted in further division particles as indicated from the morphological study. Zn (II) was subjected to adsorptionon the synthesized adsorbent. It was observed that the rate of adsorption increased significantly on the nickel deposited carbon than the carbon alone. Morris-Weber, Lagergren and Reichenberg models were applied to find out the type and rate of adsorption employingfirst and second order rate equations.The adsorption data were applied toLangmuir, Freundlich and D-R isotherms and values of isotherm constants were calculated and were higher for Ni/C than carbon alone. The mean free energy of zinc sorption on carbon and Ni/C are 16.67 and 18.26 kJmol-1 which shows chemisorption. Thermodynamic studies were done to find out the effect of temperature on sorption. Positive values of ΔH and negative values of ΔG show endothermic and spontaneous type of sorption.',\n",

Molecular details underlying polyamine-mediated photoprotective mechanisms are not completely resolved. This study investigated the role of spermidine (Spd) in the structure and function of the photosynthetic apparatus. Tomato seedlings were subjected to salinity-alkalinity stress with and without foliar application of Spd, and photosynthetic and morphological parameters were analyzed. Leaf dry weight and net photosynthetic rate were reduced by salinity-alkalinity stress. Salinity-alkalinity stress reduced photochemical quenching parameters, including maximum photochemistry efficiency of photosystem II, quantum yield of linear electron flux, and coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP). Salinity-alkalinity stress elevated nonphotochemical quenching parameters, including the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). Microscopic analysis revealed that salinity-alkalinity stress disrupted the internal lamellar system of granal and stromal thylakoids. Exogenous Spd alleviated the stress-induced reduction of leaf dry weight, net photosynthetic rate, and qP parameters. The NPQ parameters increased by salinity-alkalinity stress were also alleviated by Spd. Seedlings treated with exogenous Spd had higher zeaxanthin (Z) contents than those without Spd under salinity-alkalinity stress. The chloroplast ultrastructure had a more ordered arrangement in seedlings treated with exogenous Spd than in those without Spd under salinity-alkalinity stress. These results indicate that exogenous Spd can alleviate the growth inhibition and thylakoid membrane photodamage caused by salinity-alkalinity stress. The Spd-induced accumulation of Z also may have an important role in stabilizing the photosynthetic apparatus.',\n",

The wavelet kernel in RKHS is a kind of multidimensional wavelet function that can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions. Implications on semiparametric estimation are proposed in this paper.

The experimental results indicate that the WSVM classifier can obtain the highest accuracy when using the Coiflet Kernel function in wavelet transform.

The influences of La2O3 and silica textural structure on the gold dispersion, formation of active species, crystalline composition and the reacting role of dopants were studied in detail. The characterization results suggested that the dispersion of gold nanoparticles depended on the textural structure of silica without lanthanum oxide doping where small mesopores are more preferable to disperse gold nanoparticles. The addition of lanthanum oxide largely increased the dispersion of gold nanoparticles and oxygen active sites independent of the textural structure of silica support. The interaction between lanthanum oxide and silica enhanced by the synergy facilitated the release of oxygen vacancies and transition of active oxygen species. In addition, the chemical properties were greatly changed after lanthanum oxide addition which was only inconspicuously impacted by the initial textural structure of silica supports, shedding light on the further design of economic gold catalyst based on simple synthesis method.',\n",

Success of public urban areas in attraction of residents depends on thermal comfort of the visitors. Thermal comfort of urban open spaces is variable, because it depends on climatic parameters and other influences, which are changeable throughout the year, as well as during the day. Therefore, the prediction of thermal comfort is significant in order to enable planning the time of usage of urban open spaces. This paper presents Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict thermal comfort of visitors at an open urban area. Results from SVM-FFA were compared with two other soft computing method namely artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic programming (GP). The purpose of this research is also to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) emission based on the urban and rural population growth. Estimating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at an urban scale is the first step for adaptation and mitigation of climate change by local governments. The environment that governs the relationships between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) changes over time due to variations in economic growth, regulatory policy and technology. The relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions is considered as one of the most important empirical relationships. GDP is also predicted based on CO2 emissions. The reliability of the computational models were accessed based on simulation results and using several statistical indicators.',\n",

Chi-square test was used to compare the groups regarding genotype and the allele frequencies, HWE test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.       Results   The frequencies of TNF-α-308 GA and AA genotypes were significantly higher in case family than that in control family.

It is not an easy task to design CDK2-selective inhibitors which do not exhibit activity for other CDK family members, particularly CDK4, due to a high degree of structural homology among CDK family members. In this study, 4-substituted N-phenylpyrimidin-2-amine derivatives as CDK2 inhibitors were examined to understand the selectivity mechanism against CDK4 using a combined approach of 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, MESP, MD simulations, and binding free energy calculations. 3D-QSAR models were developed to propose structural determinants for CDK2 and CDK4 inhibition. High q2 and r2 values for CoMFA and CoMSIA models based on both internal and external validations suggested that the generated 3D-QSAR models may exhibit good capability to predict bioactivities of inhibitors against CDK2 or CDK4. Electrostatic potentials on the molecular surface have been discussed in detail for determining the binding affinity of studied inhibitors by combining molecular docking with MESP and Mulliken charge analyses. Binding free energy calculations suggested that the residues Gln85, Asp86, and Lys89 of CDK2 would play a critical role in selective CDK2 inhibition. The electrostatic interactions of an inhibitor with Glu144 and Asn145 of CDK4 may predominately drive CDK4 inhibition. These findings may provide a better structural understanding of the mechanism of CDK2 selective inhibition. The results obtained in the current study may provide valuable guidelines for developing novel potent and selective CDK2 inhibitors.',\n",

Method   Fifteen matched pairs of frozen unpreserved femurs were used in the study. Two pressure transducers and two thermocouples were screwed into holes drilled into the femoral shaft. The femurs were stabilized in the vertical position by mechanically attaching them to a custom jig equipped with a load cell to detect the vertical component of force applied to the reamer. Proximally a linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) was attached to the reamer to record the continuous position of the reamer.   All femurs were reamed to a diameter 2 mm larger than the narrowest point of the canal. Proximal and distal pressures, proximal and distal temperatures, applied vertical force and displacement were measured continuously throughout the reaming process. Maximum and minimum, and average proximal and distal pressures for each reamer were obtained and compared using paired t-tests. Averages were also calculated and compared in the same manner.

No appreciable temperature changes were observed during any of the trials.

       "  'abstract': 'Major depression is one of the world’s most common medical problems, being the leading cause of disability in developed nations worldwide and the third overall cause of global disease burden (1). In the United States, approximately 7% of the population experiences depression each year (2). Although there is some variability in rates of depression among different groups, nonetheless it strikes across ethnic, racial, national and socioeconomic boundaries (3). As a major public health problem, treatment of depression is of paramount importance, yet relatively few advances in treatments have occurred for nearly two decades and available interventions fail to provide timely relief for many affected people (4). New interventions are clearly needed, but to make these advances, a better understanding of the brain basis of depression is necessary. In this section of Current Psychiatry Reports, several leading experts examine aspects of the treatment of depression ranging from specific subgroups (e.g., depression complicated by psychosis) to specific aspects of the illness (namely suicide). To help frame these discussions, the possible underlying functional neuroanatomy of depression is also reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepression complicates (and is complicated by) a number of different conditions, but one of the more common associations is with alcoholism. As described by DeVido and Weiss (5), alcohol use disorders are nearly three times more common in depressed individuals than the general population and the converse is also true, i.e., that depression is over-represented in people with alcoholism. These patients are more likely to exhibit poor treatment outcomes and all aspects of treatment, from initial assessment to treatment decisions to treatment adherence, are more difficult than in subjects with each condition separately. Historically, treatment of the depressed alcoholic has often focused on one or the other condition first, only to treat the other after the first had resolved. DeVido and Weiss present evidence that integrated treatment, in which both conditions are managed under a single treatment program or team, is the most effective approach. Additionally, integration of both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may provide additional benefit (5). Integrated treatment is, unfortunately, not widely available; the arguments presented by DeVido and Weiss suggest that expanding these opportunities could provide a major advance in this common co-occurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough major depression causes significant morbidity, clearly the most tragic outcome of depression is death by suicide. Suicide prevention is a primary goal in the treatment of anyone with depression, yet even with advances in treatment approaches, it has not been clear whether progress toward this goal is being made. Schwartz-Lifshitz et al (6) observe that although a number of risk factors for suicide, including the presence of major depression, have been identified, because these characteristics are generally common and suicide is generally rare, preventing suicide remains challenging. They suggest that prevention of suicide requires not only alert, thorough clinical care, but also community and social participation that includes public education and responsible media coverage in order to impact the prevalence of suicide. Their article reminds us that everyone, not just patient advocacy groups and mental health care providers, are responsible for improving outcomes of people suffering from depression and other mental illnesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepression is variable in its presentation as a number of different symptom complexes occur. Psychotic depression is one such variant, and the occurrence of psychosis during a depressive episode is associated with a worse course of illness. It has been recognized for many years that depression complicated by psychosis is poorly responsive to antidepressant monotherapy, requiring concurrent administration of an antipsychotic (7). However, as discussed by Nelson (7), abnormalities of the HPA-axis observed in psychotic depression suggest alternative approaches that might be effective. In particular, he describes how treatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone may be an effective intervention in this subtype of major depression. This novel approach suggests alternative mechanisms toward treatment development that may lead in the future to better interventions in this patient population.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, I am frequently struck by how, even though I graduated from residency almost 25 years ago, our treatments for major depression have minimally changed since then, remaining primarily linked to modulating monoamine levels, particularly serotonin. Although there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this approach, unfortunately our current treatments fail to provide significant improvement, particularly recovery, nearly half the time (8). As noted, given the public health significance of major depression, novel treatments are desperately needed. Murrough and Charney (8) address this limitation in our antidepressant options, but note promising new leads in drugs that modulate the glutamatergic system. In particularly, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine provides a model for developing new agents within this system. Perhaps more importantly, ketamine reminds us to reconsider historical notions of the neurobiology of depression to foster development of alternative strategies for treatments beyond the monoaminergic modulation models that have dominated antidepressant development for more than fifty years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, it is likely that our ability to treat major depression will not dramatically improve until we better understand its neurobiology. Complicating these efforts is the observation that depression appears to arise nonspecifically in response to a wide variety of brain insults ranging from stroke and schizophrenia to infection and traumatic brain injury. This observation suggests that the neurobiology of depression is variable and may be related specifically to its underlying causes that are often difficult to identify. Nonetheless, despite different etiologies, a common end-state does occur (namely depression) which may have a shared neurobiology that could provide a target for treatment development despite the heterogeneity of this condition. Specifically, as outlined by Pandya et al (9), depression does not neatly localize into singular brain regions, but affects distributed corticolimbic networks. However, measurements of the function of components within these networks might offer opportunities to develop objective markers of early treatment response, if not specific locations to apply neuromodulatory treatments such as rTMS (9). Moving from functional neuroanatomic to molecular understanding of the brain pathology underlying depression may provide even better alternatives to guide treatments in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough major depression remains a far too common, complicated condition to manage, these articles suggest that progress is steadily being made that may ultimately provide marked improvements in treatments for this condition. The approaches highlighted - i.e., to focus on specific subgroups, specific behaviors, and novel treatment interventions, while better understanding the neurobiology of the illness – offer promise for these very improvements. With these approaches, we can be optimistic that our options for those patients presenting in our offices with major depression will truly expand so that, in the future, we can over interventions that provide quick, predictable relief. We are hopeful that the articles included in this issue will inspire investigators toward that very progress in order to improve the lives of our patients.',\n",

Modern exploitation requires better understanding of important source rocks and reservoirs at outcrop scale. Remote sensing of outcrops is becoming a first order tool for reservoir analog studies including horizontal heterogeneities. This work used ground-based hyperspectral imaging, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and high-resolution photography to study a roadcut of the Boone Formation at Bella Vista, northwest Arkansas, and developed an outcrop model for reservoir analog analyses.   The petroliferous Boone Formation consists of fossiliferous limestones interbedded with chert of early Mississippian age. We used remote sensing techniques to identify rock types and to collect 3D geometrical data. Mixture tuned matched filtering classification of hyperspectral data show that the outcrop is mostly limestones with interbedded chert nodules. 1315 fractures were classified according to their strata-bounding relationships, among these, larger fractures are dominantly striking in ENE – WSW directions. Fracture extraction data show that chert holds more fractures than limestones, and both vertical and horizontal heterogeneities exist in chert nodule distribution.   Utilizing ground-based remote sensing, we have assembled a virtual outcrop model to extract mineral composition as well as fracture data from the model. We inferred anisotropy in vertical fracture permeability based on the dominancy of fracture orientations, the preferential distribution of fractures and distribution of chert nodules. These data are beneficial in reservoir analogs to study rock mechanics and fluid flow, and to improve well performances.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As obesity and metabolic diseases rise, there is need to investigate physiological and behavioural aspects associated with their development. Circadian rhythms have a profound influence on metabolic processes, as they prepare the body to optimise energy use and storage. Moreover, food-related signals confer temporal order to organs involved in metabolic regulation. Therefore food intake should be synchronised with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to elaborate efficient responses to environmental challenges. Human studies suggest that a loss of synchrony between mealtime and the SCN promotes obesity and metabolic disturbances. Animal research using different paradigms has been performed to characterise the effects of timing of food intake on metabolic profiles. Therefore the purpose of the present review is to critically examine the evidence of animal studies, to provide a state of the art on metabolic findings and to assess whether the paradigms used in rodent models give the evidence to support a ‘best time’ for food intake. First we analyse and compare the current findings of studies where mealtime has been shifted out of phase from the light–dark cycle. Then, we analyse studies restricting meal times to different moments within the active period. So far animal studies correlate well with human studies, demonstrating that restricting food intake to the active phase limits metabolic disturbances produced by high-energy diets and that eating during the inactive/sleep phase leads to a worse metabolic outcome. Based on the latter we discuss the missing elements and possible mechanisms leading to the metabolic consequences, as these are still lacking.',\n",

Infection therefore occurs under reducing conditions induced by physiological agents (e.g. glutathione) or the intestinal bacterial flora. After excretion in the environment, phage particles are exposed to oxidizing conditions and sometimes disinfection. If inactivation does not occur, the phage may infect new hosts in the human gut through the oral route. During such a life cycle, we demonstrated that, outside the human gut, cysteines of the major protein capsid of Qβ phage form disulfide bonds. Disinfection with NaClO does not allow overoxidation to occur. Such oxidation induces inactivation rather by irreversible damage to the minor proteins. In the presence of glutathione, most disulfide bonds are reduced, which slightly increases the capacity of the phage to infect E. coli in vitro Such reduction is reversible and barely alters infectivity of the phage. Reduction of all disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol leads to complete capsid destabilization. These data provide new insights into how the phages are impacted by oxidizing-reducing conditions outside their host cell and raises the possibility of the intervention of the redox during life cycle of the phage.',\n",

We tried to clarify this aspect using transcranial cerebellar direct current stimulation (tcDCS) and studying changes in perceptive threshold (PT), pain intensity (VAS) and laser evoked potentials (LEPs) responses (N1 and N2/P2).       Materials and methods   Fifteen subjects were studied before and after anodal, cathodal and sham tcDCS. LEPs were obtained using a Nd:YAP laser; signals were amplified, band pass filtered. The left hand dorsum was stimulated by laser pulses with short duration (5\\xa0ms) and small diameter spots (5\\xa0mm). VAS was evaluated by delivering laser pulses at two different intensities, respectively two and three times the pain threshold (PT).       Results   Cathodal polarization dampened the PT and increased the VAS score, while the anodal one had opposite effects ( p   p         Discussion   tcDCS modulates pain perception and its cortical correlates. As it is effective on N1 and N2/P2 components and these responses are generated by parallel and partially segregated spinal pathways reaching different cortical targets, we speculate that the cerebellum modulates the activity of both somatosensory and cingulate cortices, interfering with the sensory-discriminative as well as emotional dimensions of pain.

For those inclined to accept prioritarianism, this refinement seems intuitive: Shouldn't we give priority both to those who are worse off and to those at a higher desert level? This article considers the viability of desert-modulated prioritarianism using the framework of claims-across-outcomes (‘claims’). I have previously used this framework to provide a unified defence of the Pareto and Pigou–Dalton axioms. With further, plausible, axioms, we arrive at prioritarianism. Should the strength of an individual's claim depend upon her desert? If so, we should accept a new axiom, Priority for the More Deserving. But Priority for the More Deserving can conflict with the Pareto axioms, if desert is intrapersonally variable rather than fixed. We should therefore reject Priority for the More Deserving and conclude that desert-modulated prioritarianism is a non-starter.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Selenate removal from mine waters is required to mitigate human and environmental health impacts. In this study, the performance of an inverse fluidised bed reactor (IFBR) for the biological removal of selenate from synthetic mine water (pH 6.0-7.0) was evaluated. A laboratory-scale IFBR was set up with floating biomass carriers. Selenate reducers were enriched from environmental samples and anaerobic sludge. The synthetic medium contained ~10 mM (~1.4 g L-1) selenate, nutrients and 10 mM ethanol as electron donor. During stable performance the bioreactor achieved 94 % removal of selenate representing a removal rate of 251 mg L-1 d-1 at a hydraulic retention time of 5 d. Selenite concentration remained < 1 mg L-1 during stable performance, and the formation of a red precipitate indicated that selenate was reduced to elemental selenium. The biological selenate reduction generated alkalinity, increasing the wastewater pH from 6.0 to 8.6. The redox potential gradually approached a value ranging from -300 mV to -400 mV against standard hydrogen electrode. Overall, the results showed that the IFBR can be used for removing selenate and acidity from mine waters. Moreover, it has potential to facilitate recovery of elemental selenium. Therefore, the bioprocess provides an opportunity to reduce the costs and liabilities associated with selenium containing mine drainage and the associated environmental impacts.',\n",

Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis may contribute to functional stroke outcomes. Low levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) correlate with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. However, once a stroke occurs, hypothyroidism is associated with more favorable outcomes. It is well known that thyroid hormone levels drop rapidly in critically ill patients (“sick-euthryoid” syndrome), which may be prevented by the exogenous thyroid replacement provided to hypothyroid patients. We directly assessed thyroid function with measurements of TSH, free T3 (fT3) and free T4 (fT4) in patients with ischemic stroke and evaluated acute and long-term outcomes.\\n\\nMethods: Blood was collected prospectively from patients with radiologically confirmed ischemic stroke (AIS) (n=136) 24 hours after symptom onset. Serum levels of TSH, fT4, and fT3 were quantified by ELISA. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and admission NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Secondary outcomes were admission to discharge change in NIHSS, modified Barthel Index (mBI) and modified Rankin score (mRs) at 3 and 12 months (mo), and mortality at 3 and 12 mo.\\n\\nResults: AIS patients show a negative correlation in fT3 with age (r=-.332, p<0.01 ). AIS patients with a higher pre-stroke mRS had higher levels of fT3, and fT4 , p=0.01, p=0.03 ). Patients that died or went to hospice had significantly lower levels of fT3 and TSH (1.99pg/ml (1.75-2.48), 0.52 pg/ml (0.30-0.76)).TSH levels were lower in AIS patients with worsened NIHSS (0.72 pg/ml (0.36-1.12)). Higher fT3 levels were significantly associated with better mRS and mBI at 3 and 12 mo ( p=0.01, p=0.01, p=0.03, p=0.02 ), whereas lower levels of TSH were significant for worse mRS at 3mo (0.87pg/ml (0.59-1.48)).\\n\\nConclusion: While higher levels of fT3 correlate with stroke risk factors, high fT3 is seen in patients with better functional outcome at 3 and 12mo post-stroke. Ischemic stroke patients with low TSH levels at 24 hrs have higher mortality. Thus, monitoring the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis during acute stroke may improve long-term stroke outcomes.',\n",

The synthesis of remdesivir is, however, challenging, and the overall cost is relatively high. Particularly, the stereoselective assembly of the P-chirogenic center requires recrystallization of a 1:1 isomeric p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate mixture several times to obtain the desired diastereoisomer (39%) for further coupling with the d-ribose-derived 5-alcohol. To address this problem, a variety of chiral bicyclic imidazoles were synthesized as organocatalysts for stereoselective (S)-P-phosphoramidation employing a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of phosphoramidoyl chloridates as the coupling reagent to avoid a waste of the other diastereomer. Through a systematic study of different catalysts at different temperatures and concentrations, a mixture of the (S)- and (R)-P-phosphoramidates was obtained in 97% yield with a 96.1/3.9 ratio when 20 mol % of the chiral imidazole-cinnamaldehyde-derived carbamate was utilized in the reaction at -20 °C. A 10-g scale one-pot synthesis via a combination of (S)-P-phosphoramidation and protecting group removal followed by one-step recrystallization gave remdesivir in 70% yield and 99.3/0.7 d.r.

Materials and methods   This study collected data, including age and sex, from 40 patients with SBDs who underwent CT exams. The imaging features of the SBDs were assessed in terms of their location, average size, the relationship of their contour with the cortical plate of the lingual mandible, bone margins, degree of internal density, shape, topographic relationship between the defect and the mandibular edge, the distance from the SBD to the base of the mandible, and the Ariji classification (type I, II, and III).   Results   The average age was 57.3 years (range, 28-78 years), and the patients were predominantly male (70%). In all cases (100%), the posterior unilateral lingual SBD variant was observed. Within the Ariji classification, type I was the most common (60%). Among the most frequently observed radiographic characteristics were thick sclerotic bone margin across the entire defect contour, completely hypointense internal content, an oval shape, and continuity with the mandibular base with discontinuity of the mandibular edge.   Conclusion   This study showed that posterior SBDs could present with an oval or rounded shape, complete hypodensity, and thick sclerotic margins. Likewise, SBDs could appear almost anywhere, with minor differences from the classic SBD appearance.

However my problem (or, to be more exact, my concern or maybe my own ignorance) is how to translate queer theory into the practice of everyday politics, especially in the postwar areas of the former Yugoslavia.

To achieve sensitive target detection and accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, a large number of receiving antenna elements are needed. The high dimension of the element-level data inevitably leads to a large computational burden for digital signal processing. This problem can be overcome by transforming the element-level data into a lower dimensional beamspace. In this article, we present a novel parameter-controlled design method to construct this transformation. If the dimension reduction is not too drastic, it jointly achieves optimal detection and DOA estimation performance. Otherwise, it meets predefined performance criteria by exploiting an acceptable tradeoff between detection and DOA estimation performance. We propose a general design tool, which is not limited to a specific array configuration. It comprises a precalculated set of plots, providing the radar designer an overview of possible performance for a given scenario. We describe a straightforward method to construct the corresponding transformation. Numerical studies highlight the superiority of the proposed design method.',\n",

The median brain cooling was about 1°C during 15 min diving, but in some cases it was as much as 2.5°C. Cooling rates were slow for the first couple of minutes, but increased significantly after about 5 min of diving. The onset of cooling sometimes occurred before the start of the dive, confirming that the cooling is under cortical control, like the rest of the diving responses.   T   aorta   also fell significantly, and was always lower than   T   brain , while   T   m   was fairly stable during dives. Detailed studies of the vascular anatomy of front flippers revealed that brachial arterial blood can be routed either through flipper skin capillaries for nutritive purposes and return through sophisticated vascular heat exchangers to avoid heat loss to the environment, or, alternatively, through numerous arterio-venous shunts in the skin and return by way of large superficial veins, which then carry cold blood to the heart. In the latter situation the extent to which the brain is cooled is determined by the ratio of carotid to brachial arterial blood flow, and water temperature, and the cooling is selective in that only those organs that are circulated will be cooled. It is concluded that   T   brain   is actively down-regulated during diving, sometimes by as much as 2.5°C, whereby cerebral oxygen requirements may be reduced by as much as 25% during extended dives.',\n",

Obtained results indicate that the phase constituent of the Mg–Zn–Y–Zr alloy and the chemical composition of W-phase vary with the partial substitution of Nd for Y. After solution treatment at 480\\xa0°C for 8\\xa0h, the secondary phases dissolve into the matrix and ZnZr particles precipitate at grain interiors. During subsequent aging treatment, higher density of             β       1       ′             and             β       2       ′             phases, Mg12Nd phase, long period stacking ordered (LPSO) and stacking fault (SF) structures precipitate in Mg–Zn–Y–Zr alloy with Nd substitution. The precipitation strengthening further help the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the alloy with Nd substitution reach up to 268\\xa0MPa and 164\\xa0MPa, respectively. The damping capacities of the investigated alloys decrease dramatically after heat treatment. The decline in damping of solution-treated alloys can be ascribed to the increasing number of solute atoms and ZnZr particles. Due to the stacking fault probability, LPSO and SF structures induced by the Nd substitution are believed to be the new damping source to contribute to the damping capacity of Mg–Zn–Y–Zr alloy besides dislocations.',\n",

It is shown that this theory, formulated in the appropriate basis, is capable of describing the Kitaev spin liquid as well as the transition between the gapless ${Z}_{2}$ spin liquid and the so-called stripy antiferromagnet. Within our mean-field theory, we find a discontinuous transition from the ${Z}_{2}$ spin liquid to the stripy antiferromagnet.

A few zircons are completely metamorphic. Most detrital cores have relatively high REE contents and Th/U ratios and yield highly variable 206Pb/238U ages ranging from 2828 to 211\\xa0Ma, with major age populations at ∼1800\\xa0Ma and ∼800\\xa0Ma for quartzites and ∼1300\\xa0Ma for marbles. In contrast, the metamorphic zircon rims have relatively low REE contents and low Th/U ratios, and yield consistent Triassic metamorphic ages with a weighted mean age of 231\\xa0Ma. These results indicate that the marble and quartzite, together with eclogite and orthogneiss from the southern Sulu orogenic belt, have been subjected to a coeval Triassic UHP metamorphism. The protoliths of the quartzites may have been formed in the Neoproterozoic, whereas the protoliths of the marble are probably in the Mesoproterozoic. The source regions of the UHP supracrustal rocks underwent Neoproterozoic to Paloproterozoic tectonic–thermal events, indicating that the protoliths of the Sulu UHP rocks were derived from the Yangtze craton, instead of the North China craton.',\n",

Canadian studies are mainly representative of specific cities and/or provinces. Therefore, the study aims to assess the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy and its associated risk factors throughout the Canadian provinces and territories. The analysis was based on the Maternity Experience Survey targeting women aged ≥15 years who had singleton live births during 2005/06 in the Canadian provinces and territories. The outcome was ever smoking during the thirst trimester of pregnancy. Socio-economic factors, demographic factors, maternal characteristics, and pregnancy related factors that proved to be significant at the bivariate level were considered for a logistic regression analysis. Bootstrapping was performed to account for the complex sampling design. The sample size was 6,421 weighted to represent 76,508 Canadian women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 10.5%, whereby smoking mothers consumed on average 7 cigarettes a day (95% Confidence interval - CI: 6.5-7.4; SD = 5.7). Regression analysis revealed that mothers who smoked during pregnancy were more likely to be of low socio-economic status, non-immigrant, single and passive smokers during pregnancy. Not attending prenatal classes and experiencing stressful events before/during pregnancy also increased the mothers' odds of smoking during pregnancy. While the age of the mother's first pregnancy was negatively associated with smoking during pregnancy, the mother's current age was positively associated with it. Smoking during pregnancy is still prevalent among Canadian women. The findings may be useful to enhance smoking prevention programs and integrated health promotion strategies to promote positive health behaviors among disadvantaged pregnancies.\",\n",

The parameters and their assigned weights were integrated using Geographic Information System (GIS) software to generate recharge potential maps. The resultant maps were evaluated using the area under the curve method. The results showed that the southern regions of the Willochra Basin are more promising for groundwater recharge potential. The map produced using the frequency ratio model was the most efficient (84%), followed by the multi-influencing factor model (70%) and then the analytical hierarchy process technique (62%).

Due to the ability of oxoG to form oxoG:A mispairs, this base is highly mutagenic. Its repair requires the action of two enzymes: 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Fpg or MutM in bacteria and OGG1 in eukaryotes), which removes oxoG from oxoG:C pairs, and adenine DNA glycosylase (MutY in bacteria and MUTYH in eukaryotes), which removes A from oxoG:A mispairs to prevent mutations.

Participants: The study sample comprised 3938 men and 5056 women aged 18–84 from the Stockholm Public Health Cohort reporting occasional low back pain in the baseline questionnaire 2006. Measures: Lifestyle factors and potential confounders were assessed at baseline. The lifestyle factors smoking habits, alcohol consumption, leisure physical activity and consumption of fruit and vegetables were dichotomised using recommendations for a healthenhancing lifestyle and combined to form the exposure variable ‘healthy lifestyle behaviour’. The exposure was categorised into five levels according to the number of healthy lifestyle factors met. The follow-up questionnaire in 2010 gave information about the outcome, long duration troublesome low back pain. Crude and adjusted binomial regression models were applied to estimate the association between the exposure and the outcome analysing men and women separately. Results: The risk of developing long duration troublesome low back pain among women with occasional low back pain decreased with increasing healthy lifestyle behaviour (trend test: p=0.006). 21% (28/131) among women with no healthy lifestyle factor (reference) experienced the outcome compared to 9% (36/420) among women with all four factors.

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation (me3) of histone H3 lysine 27 (K27), and it is believed that this activity mediates transcriptional repression. Despite the recent progress in understanding PcG function, the molecular mechanisms by which the PcG proteins repress transcription, as well as the mechanisms that lead to the activation of PcG target genes are poorly understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we have determined the global changes in histone modifications in embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking the PcG protein Suz12 that is essential for PRC2 activity. We show that loss of PRC2 activity results in a global increase in H3K27 acetylation. The methylation to acetylation switch correlates with the transcriptional activation of PcG target genes, both during ES cell differentiation and in MLL-AF9-transduced hematopoietic stem cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the acetylation of H3K27 is catalyzed by the acetyltransferases p300 and CBP. Based on these data, we propose that the PcG proteins in part repress transcription by preventing the binding of acetyltransferases to PcG target genes.',\n",

We investigated the role of intracortical inhibition in the primary motor cortex (M1) during motor skill learning. Event-related transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess corticomotor excitability and inhibition thought to involve synaptic and extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Short intracortical inhibition (SICI) was assessed using 1- and 2.5-ms interstimulus intervals (ISIs). Participants learned a novel, sequential pinch-grip task on a computer in either a repetitive or interleaved practice structure. Both practice structures showed equivalent levels of motor performance at the end of acquisition and at retention 1 wk later. There was a novel task-related modulation of 1-ms SICI. Repetitive practice elicited a greater reduction of 1- and 2.5-ms SICI, i.e., disinhibition, between rest and task acquisition, compared with interleaved practice. These novel findings support the use of a repetitive practice structure for motor learning because the associated effects within M1 have relevance for motor rehabilitation.',\n",

Both working memory (WM) and the congruency of the immediately preceding trial have also been shown to moderate the magnitude of Stroop interference. Specifically, interference is smaller both for individuals with higher working memory capacity and following an incongruent trial. At present, it is unclear whether and how these 3 variables (age, WM and previous congruency) interact to predict interference effects in the standard Stroop color-naming task. We present analyses of Stroop interference in a large database of Stroop color-naming trials from a lifespan sample of well-screened, cognitively healthy, older adults. Our results indicated age-related increases in interference (after controlling for processing speed) that were exaggerated for individuals with low WM. This relationship between age and WM occurred primarily when the immediately preceding trial was congruent. Following an incongruent trial, interference increased consistently with age, regardless of WM. Taken together, these results support previous accounts of multiple mechanisms underlying control in the Stroop task and provide insight into how each component is jointly affected by age, WM, and trial history.',\n",

Upon activation, the inflammasome induces processing and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) via activation of caspase-1/11. Previously, it was shown that complete caspase-1 deficiency is protective against atherosclerosis development. However, while macrophages are the main inflammatory cells involved in atherosclerosis, the exact role of macrophage-specific caspase-1/11 activation during development of cardiovascular disease has never been investigated. We hypothesized that hematopoietic caspase-1/11 deficiency leads to reduced atherosclerosis development. To investigate the specific contribution of hematopoietic caspase-1/11 activation to atherosclerosis development, Ldlr(-/-) mice received a transplant (tp) of wild-type (WT) or caspase-1/11(-/-) bone marrow, to create WT-tp mice and caspase-1/11(-/-) -tp mice, and fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. Our results showed an increase in anti-inflammatory blood leukocytes in caspase-1/11(-/-) -tp mice compared with WT-tp mice, as indicated by a decreased level of Ly6C(high) monocytes and an increased level of Ly6C(low) monocytes. In line with our hypothesis, hematopoietic deletion of caspase-1/11 resulted in a strong reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size. Furthermore, necrotic core content was dramatically decreased in caspase-1/11(-/-) -tp mice. Our data indicate that hematopoietic caspase-1/11 activation is involved in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, and plays an important role in cardiovascular disease progression.',\n",

The 3-D numerical simulation software, RAMMS, is used to back calculate the event and predict the future hazard. Coulomb and viscous turbulent friction, μ and ξ are calibrated in RAMMS. Numerical simulation reveals the movement process of Chutou gully from the aspects of flow depth, velocity, discharge, and run-out solid materials volume. The simulation results show that more than two-thirds of the solid materials are still deposited in the main channel, which could provide material basis for the re-occurrence of high hazard debris flow. In addition, based on the intensity and probability of debris flow, the hazard of debris flow is divided into high, middle, and low degrees. According to the simulation results and hazard assessment model, the hazard map of Chutou gully debris flow in various rainstorm return periods (20, 50, 100, and 200 years) is established, which can provide guidance for the future land-use planning and debris flow prevention works.',\n",

These regions are highly susceptible to coastal erosion with its dense population, developed economy and low-lying land. Due to immense natural and human pressures, there is an urgent need for a more comprehensive understanding of coastal erosion risk in such areas. Various models have been established, but most of them focused on sandy coasts and physical factors that influence coastal erosion while socioeconomic factors were usually ignored. Accordingly, this study presents a GIS-based risk assessment of coastal erosion for muddy coasts by combining both the physical and socioeconomic aspects of erosion. The method is used to assess coastal erosion risk in the Yangtze Delta. Based on the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response) framework, 10 vulnerability indicators and 3 impact indicators corresponding to physical and socioeconomic aspects, respectively, are identified to constitute an indicator system. These indicators are weighted using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique, and then are combined into a Vulnerability Index and a Hazard Index, which then are merged into a Risk Index. Then, these indexes are normalized to 0%–100%. Finally, the normalized values are ranked into 5 levels: very low (<20%), low (20%\\xa0≤\\xa0Is<40%), moderate (40%\\xa0≤\\xa0Is<60%), high (60%\\xa0≤\\xa0Is<80%) or very high (≥80%). This study is the first to comprehensively assess coastal erosion risk in the Yangtze Delta by integrating physical and socioeconomic factors at a detailed spatial scale. The results provide a clear picture of the current coastal erosion risk in the study area, despite of some limitations. The study also reveals key gaps in data gathering and coastal management practices that need to be addressed in order to develop more effective long-term coastal management.',\n",

The comparison of the numerical and experimental results show a good agreement on the energy flux density distribution on solar cells. The test results reveal that the concentrator has a relatively high solar concentrating uniformity of 0.8. The I-V test is carried out and the results indicate that the photo-electric transformation efficiencies of solar cell monomer and module are both higher than those of the CPV system with a parabolic trough concentrator. The optical analyses of the concentrator are also carried out. The results show that the geometric concentrating ratio increases with the increasing of solar cell installing height. When the solar cell installing height is fixed, the peak value of geometric concentrating ratio exists as the slope angle of focal plane increases from 0° to 90°. The sun-tracking error effect analysis results indicate that the relative optical efficiency of the CPV system could be 0.8 or even higher under normal sun-tracking condition.',\n",

The aim of this study is to investigate the rate of rehabilitation therapy utilization over time in patients with PD using a nationwide cohort in Korea. Methods. Patients were identified using the registration code for PD in the program for rare, intractable disease from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database, which consists of 979,390 Korean residents. Data were divided into four periods: 2004–2006, 2007–2009, 2010–2012, and 2013–2015. We assessed the utilization of rehabilitation therapies and the associated patient characteristics. Results. The numbers of patients with PD were 384 in 2004, 855 in 2007, 1,023 in 2010, and 1,222 in 2013. The numbers of physiatrist visits per person were 0.58, 0.96, 1.97, and 2.91, in the respective periods. Among the patients, 35–40% had claims for physical therapy, 16–19% for occupational therapy, and 4–6% for swallowing therapy. There were no remarkable differences between these rates between the study periods. Sex, age, income, disability, and levodopa-equivalent dose were significantly associated with the utilization of rehabilitation therapy. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that the rate of rehabilitation therapy utilization did not change remarkably in patients with PD from 2004 to 2015 in Korea although the number of physiatrist visits increased dramatically. The present evidence and guidelines may have not been adequately integrated into clinical practice during the period of study. Additional efforts may be warranted to provide adequate rehabilitation therapies in clinical practice for patients with PD.',\n",

Several case–control studies and even a meta-analysis have confirmed a link between venous thrombosis and hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine is due to genetic and acquired factors (poor diet in folate and vitamin B12, older age, renal impairment, thyroid diseases, and malignancies) induced by the intake and the concentrations of vitamin B9 or B12 in the majority of cases. We report the cases of four Moroccan patients who presented with acute vein thrombosis of different sites: a 34-year-old man, a 60-year-old man, a 58-year-old man, and a 47-year-old woman. All patients had a low level of cobalamin with marked hyperhomocysteinemia with normal serum and red cell folic acid. Venous thrombosis revealed pernicious anemia in all patients. Their low levels of cobalamin, atrophic gastritis, and positive results for gastric parietal cell antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of pernicious anemia. There was no evidence of immobilization, recent surgery, malignancy, antiphospholipid antibody, myeloproliferative disorder, or hormone replacement therapy. No deficiencies in protein C and protein S were detected; they had normal antithrombin III function and factor V Leiden; no prothrombin gene mutations were detected. Treatment included orally administered anticoagulation therapy and cobalamin supplementation. The outcome was favorable in all cases. These reports demonstrate that pernicious anemia, on its own, can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia that is significant enough to lead to thrombosis. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of the development of thrombosis in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia related to Biermer disease would help us to identify patients at risk and to treat them accordingly.

The focus of the study is the current control loop of voltage source converters. The main merit of the proposed fractional controller formulation lies into the use of fractional exponents in the integro-derivative parts obtaining a controller with an extra degree of freedom. This degree of freedom allows the phase delay to be improved for a wide frequency range in comparison with the conventional proportional-resonant controllers. Furthermore, the obtained controller results in a lower order transfer function that reduces the computational burden when multiple current frequencies have to be tracked. As fractional integro-derivative exponents are not directly implementable, five mathematical approaches are explored, selecting the Chareff’s approximation for the fractional controller operator’s implementation. A tuning procedure for such a controller is also addressed. The new controller formulation is validated in a 20\\xa0kVA laboratory set-up based on a silicon-carbide converter, and it is implemented in a DSP. Two AC output converter’s configurations are considered to demonstrate the controllers’ tracking capability; short-circuited (balanced fault) output, and grid-connected operation.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted between August 2015 and October 2016 after obtaining the approval of the institutional ethical committee. The purpose of this study was disclosed to the participants prior to beginning the survey. The study was performed conducting a questionnaire via e-mail on three groups of participants including EPs, neurosurgeons, and radiologists. Participants comprised academic staff at university hospitals as well as department chiefs, specialists, and residents working at university, government, and private hospitals, all of whom are in charge of evaluating MHI patients. RESULTS A total of 607 participants including 201 (33.1%) EPs, 179 (29.5%) neurosurgeons, and 227 (37.4%) radiologists responded to the survey; 31% of the participants reported awareness and 27.3% reported use of head CT rules in MHI. Awareness and use of the rules were most prominent in EPs group, while the lowest rates were observed in radiologists group (p<0.01). The leading factors inhibiting the use of head CT rules in MHI stated by EPs were medicolegal anxiety (73.6%), expectations of patients and/or patient relatives (72.6%), and time constraints (44.3%). The leading factors stated by neurosurgeons were medicolegal anxiety (60.9%) and expectations of patient and/or patient relatives (46.4%); \"not being consulted in the decision-making process to obtain CT in MHI\" (65.6%) and medicolegal anxiety (49.8%) were the leading factors stated by radiologists. CONCLUSION The results of our study show that many physicians in Turkey do not have favorable attitudes regarding head CT rules in MHI. Medicolegal anxiety, expectations of patient and/or patient relatives, time constraints, wide availability of CT, and lack of adequate education on radiation protection or on patient dose from imaging are the common reasons for this practice pattern.',\n",

Recent developments in both areas have made available multi-microsecond simulations of two proteins, ubiquitin and Protein G, using a number of different force fields. Although these force fields mostly share a common mathematical form, they differ in their parameters and in the philosophy by which these were derived, and previous analyses showed varying levels of agreement with experimental NMR data. To complement the comparison to experiments, we have performed a structural analysis of and comparison between these simulations, thereby providing insight into the relationship between force-field parameterization, the resulting ensemble of conformations and the agreement with experiments. In particular, our results show that, at a coarse level, many of the motional properties are preserved across several, though not all, force fields. At a finer level of detail, however, there are distinct differences in both the structure and dynamics of the two proteins, which can, together with comparison with experimental data, help to select force fields for simulations of proteins. A noteworthy observation is that force fields that have been reparameterized and improved to provide a more accurate energetic description of the balance between helical and coil structures are difficult to distinguish from their “unbalanced” counterparts in these simulations. This observation implies that simulations of stable, folded proteins, even those reaching 10 microseconds in length, may provide relatively little information that can be used to modify torsion parameters to achieve an accurate balance between different secondary structural elements.',\n",

Such single cell behavior is often examined by flow cytometry; however, gating procedures typically employed to select a small subpopulation of cells with similar morphological characteristics make it difficult, even impossible, to quantitatively compare cells across a large variety of experimental conditions because these conditions can lead to profound morphological variations. To overcome these limitations, we developed a regression approach to correct for variability in fluorescence intensity due to differences in cell size and granularity without discarding any of the cells, which gating ipso facto does. This approach enables quantitative studies of cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional noise in high-throughput experiments involving thousands of samples. We used this approach to analyze a library of yeast knockout strains and reveal genes required for the population to establish a bimodal response to oleic acid induction. We identify a group of epigenetic regulators and nucleoporins that, by maintaining an ‘unresponsive population,' may provide the population with the advantage of diversified bet hedging.\",\n",

The TB matrix is designed to focus the transmitted energy within the desired spatial sector, thus achieving the transmit coherent gain. Due to the special data structure of the TB-based bistatic MIMO radar, a corresponding method is proposed to construct the real-valued model. Unfortunately, the existed interpolation error inevitably degrades the direction-of-departure (DOD) estimation performance. To compensate the DOD estimation error, a look-up table is created, which establishes a one-to-one mapping relationship for DOD. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on angle estimation in TB-based bistatic MIMO radar is also derived for performance analysis. Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithm has better estimation performance due to the improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain and requires less computational complexity. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the estimation performance of the proposed algorithm.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Flight initiation is fundamental for survival, escape from predators and lifting payload from one place to another in biological fliers and can be broadly classified into jumping and non-jumping takeoffs. During jumping takeoffs, the legs generate most of the initial impulse. Whereas the wings generate most of the forces in non-jumping takeoffs, which are usually voluntary, slow, and stable. It is of great interest to understand how these non-jumping takeoffs occur and what strategies insects use to generate large amount of forces required for this highly demanding flight initiation mode. Here, for the first time, we report accurate wing and body kinematics measurements of a damselfly during a non-jumping takeoff. Furthermore, using a high fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulation, we identify the 3D flow features and compute the wing aerodynamics forces to unravel the key mechanisms responsible for generating large flight forces. Our numerical results show that a damselfly generates about three times its body weight during the first half-stroke for liftoff. In generating these forces, the wings flap through a steeply inclined stroke plane with respect to the horizon, slicing through the air at high angles of attack (45°-50°). Consequently, a leading edge vortex (LEV) is formed during both the downstroke and upstroke on all the four wings. The formation of the LEV, however, is inhibited in the subsequent upstrokes following takeoff. Accordingly, we observe a drastic reduction in the magnitude of the aerodynamic force, signifying the importance of LEV in augmenting force production. Our analysis also shows that forewing-hindwing interaction plays a favorable role in enhancing both lift and thrust production during takeoff.',\n",

This situation can occur if for example congestion control requires decreasing the transmission power to reduce the channel load, but this reduction negatively influences the vehicles’ awareness range. To address these interactions or conflicts, this paper proposes and evaluates a methodology to coordinate congestion and awareness control protocols. A key advantage of the proposed methodology is that it does not require the integration of the interacting protocols, nor does it require changing their original design. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordination methodology.

A novel cross-shape patch is constructed to implement transmission stopband in the upper out-of-band so as to suppress the spurious passband. The novel UWB BPF is designed and fabricated. The measured insertion loss is less than 1.6dB, the return loss is more than 13dB and the variation of group delay is less than 0.12ns. The width of narrow notched band is about 0.15GHz and the attenuation is 18dB at the center frequency of 5.76GHz. The upper stopband is up to 15.2GHz with rejection greater than 20dB.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The imbalance between the reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species production and their handling by the antioxidant machinery (low molecular weight antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes), also known as oxidative stress, is a condition caused by physiological and pathological processes. Moreover, oxidative stress may be due to an overproduction of free radicals during physical exercise. Excess of radical species leads to the modification of molecules, such as proteins - the most susceptible to oxidative modification - lipids and DNA. With regard to the oxidation of proteins, carbonylation is an oxidative modification that has been widely described. Several studies have detected changes in the total amount of protein carbonyls following different types of physical exercise, but only few of these identified the specific amino acidic residues targets of such oxidation. In this respect, proteomic approaches allow to identify the proteins susceptible to carbonylation and in many cases, it is also possible to identify the specific protein carbonylation sites. This review focuses on the role of protein oxidation, and specifically carbonyl formation, for plasma and skeletal muscle proteins, following different types of physical exercise performed at different intensities. Furthermore, we focused on the proteomic strategies used to identify the specific protein targets of carbonylation. Overall, our analysis suggests that regular physical activity promotes a protection against protein carbonylation, due to the activation of the antioxidant defence or of the turnover of protein carbonyls. However, we can conclude that from the comprehensive bibliography analysed, there is no clearly defined specific physiological role about this post-translational modification of proteins.',\n",

The crystal results demonstrated that potassium 3-nitro-5-(nitroimino)-1-(trinitromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolate hydrate (2·H2O) exhibits an infinite two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework (MOF) containing the coordination group NO2 and metal cation K+. Additionally, this 2D MOF exhibited a high oxygen content (46.41%) and a positive oxygen balance (14.77%). Heats of formation and the detonation properties of the newly prepared compounds were calculated using the Gaussian 09 and EXPLO 5 programs, respectively. Energetic evaluation indicated that these compounds demonstrate good detonation performances, all of which outperform traditional primary explosives mercury fulminate, lead azide, 2-diazo-4,6-dinitrophenol, and in some cases, even exceed the performance of high explosive RDX. Therefore, the high detonation parameters of the compounds enable these potential primary explosives to trigger the whole detonation easily. Furthermore, several attractive properties, such as an excellent density (2.00 g cm−3), an impact sensitivity of 2 J, a friction sensitivity of 32 N, and a low amount of toxic detonation products, make 2·H2O an eco-friendly primary explosive.',\n",

A quality improvement intervention, “Adequate Birth” (PPA), based on four driving components (governance, participation of women and families, reorganisation of care, and monitoring), has been implemented to help 23 hospitals reduce their CS rate. This is a protocol designed to evaluate the implementation of PPA and its effectiveness at reducing CS as a primary outcome of birth care. Case study of PPA intervention conducted in 2017/2018. We integrated quantitative and qualitative methods into data collection and analysis. For the quantitative stage, we selected a convenient sample of twelve hospitals. In each of these hospitals, we included 400 women. This resulted in a total sample of 4800 women. We used this sample to detect a 2.5% reduction in CS rate. We interviewed managers and puerperal women, and extracted data from hospital records. In the qualitative stage, we evaluated a subsample of eight hospitals by means of systematic observation and semi-structured interviews with managers, health professionals and women. We used specific forms for each of the four PPA driving components. Forms for managers and professionals addressed the decision-making process, implemented strategies, participatory process in strategy design, and healthcare practice. Forms for women and neonatal care addressed socio-economic, demographic and health condition; prenatal and birth care; tour of the hospital before delivery; labour expectation vs. real experience; and satisfaction with care received. We will estimate the degree of implementation of PPA strategies related to two of the four driving components: “participation of women and families” and “reorganisation of care”. We will then assess its effect on CS rate and secondary outcomes for each of the twelve selected hospitals, and for the total sample. To allow for clinical, socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics in women, we will conduct multivariate analysis. Additionally, we will evaluate the influence of internal context variables (the PPA driving components “governance” and “monitoring”) on the degree of implementation of the components “participation of women and families” and “reorganisation of care”, by means of thematic content analysis. This analysis will include both quantitative and qualitative data. The effectiveness of quality improvement interventions that reduce CS rates requires examination.

Since not all protein targets have available 3D structures, ligand-based approaches are still useful. Currently, there are just a few free ligand-based pharmacophore modeling tools, and these have a lot of restrictions, e.g., using a template molecule for alignment. We developed a new approach to 3D pharmacophore representation and matching which does not require pharmacophore alignment. This representation can be used to quickly find identical pharmacophores in a given set. Based on this representation, a 3D pharmacophore ligand-based modeling approach to search for pharmacophores which preferably match active compounds and do not match inactive ones was developed. The approach searches for 3D pharmacophore models starting from 2D structures of available active and inactive compounds. The implemented approach was successfully applied for several retrospective studies. The results were compared to a 2D similarity search, demonstrating some of the advantages of the developed 3D pharmacophore models. Also, the generated 3D pharmacophore models were able to match the 3D poses of known ligands from their protein-ligand complexes, confirming the validity of the models.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the current AGI grading system and to investigate the association between AGI severity grades with clinical outcome in critically ill patients. Adult patients at 14 general intensive care units (ICUs) with an expected ICU stay ≥24\\xa0h were prospectively studied. The AGI grade was assessed daily on the basis of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, intra-abdominal pressures, and feeding intolerance (FI) in the first week of admission to the ICU. Among the 550 patients enrolled, 456 patients (82.9%) received mechanical ventilation, and 470 patients were identified for AGI. The distribution of the global AGI grade was 24.5% with grade I, 49.4% with grade II, 20.6% with grade III, and 5.5% with grade IV. AGI grading was positively correlated with 28- and 60-day mortality (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that age, sepsis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, the use of vasoactive drugs, serum creatinine and lactate levels, mechanical ventilation, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and the global AGI grade were significantly (P\\u2009≤\\u20090.02) associated with 60-day mortality.

The inhibitory effect against microorganisms has been examined using model gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. None of the tested surfactants have shown antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida) and yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula glutinis) at a concentration below 1000 μg mL(-1), however some of them were moderately active against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis). The Microtox® test was successfully applied to measure EC(50) values of the studied dicephalic cationic surfactants. Their toxicity to Vibrio fischeri depended upon the alkanoyl chain length with the EC(50) values in a range of 2.6-980 mg L(-1).

In assessing a country’s water abundance or scarcity when entering the international VW trade, scholars consider only physical water availability, neglecting economic water scarcity, which indicates situations in which socio-economic obstacles impede the productive use of water. We weight the global VW trade associated to primary crops with a newly proposed composite water scarcity index (CWSI) that combines physical and economic water scarcity. 39% of VW volumes is exported from countries with a higher CWSI than the one of the destination country. Such unfair routes occur both from low- to high-income countries and among low- and middle-income countries themselves. High-income countries have a predominant role in import of CWSI-weighted VW, while low- and middle-income countries dominate among the largest CWSI-weighted VW exporters. For many of them economic water scarcity dominates over physical scarcity. The application of the CWSI elicits also a status change from net exporter to net importer for some wealthy countries and viceversa for some low- and middle-income countries.

In this system, the photothermal effect-induced thermal expansion of pigment-PDMS could eliminate the wrinkles. The multiwavelength light-driven dynamic surface wrinkles could tune the scattering of light and the visibility of the PAN film interference color.

       "  'abstract': 'CCTV research has historically focused on four discrete dimensions: its evaluation\\r\\n, the formulation of metanarrative discourses of surveillance, its operation\\r\\n and the impact on privacy. What has consistently\\r\\nbeen missing from the research agenda is detailed accounts of how different groups understand and\\r\\nattribute meaning to the use of CCTV, and how experiences of the technology vary by individual, group,\\r\\nand location. This paper seeks to report the views and perceptions of pupils and teachers under visual\\r\\nsurveillance in their schools. The findings are organised into three central themes. Firstly, it outlines the\\r\\nlevel of awareness of CCTV at the schools amongst teachers and pupils. Awareness is inextricably linked\\r\\nwith a number of other themes, such as the effect of CCTV upon behaviour, CCTV as a deterrent against\\r\\ncriminal activity, and perceptions of the impact of CCTV on privacy, because in order for individuals to\\r\\nconceive of any of these phenomena they must first be aware of the presence of CCTV in their locale.\\r\\nSecond, it explores the meaning that the participants attribute to CCTV such as its objectives and the\\r\\nrole they perceive it to have in the school. The third and final area of investigation explores the impact\\r\\nand effectiveness of CCTV.1 In other words, what effect is CCTV perceived to have (impact) and does it\\r\\nfulfil the objectives that the participants believed it to have been implemented to achieve (effectiveness)?',\n",

The machines are directly or indirectly used in different sectors like healthcare, automatic vehicles, and complex decision-making and at the same used in educational institutes. The usage of AI-based systems and the Internet has brought numerous educational innovations for both teachers and students. With the online learning platforms grounded on AI techniques, 5G has revolutionized the teaching and learning methods by smooth and faster access to educational content. Students of foreign languages, especially English learners, can now use chatbots and intelligent tutoring systems to learn and practice their speaking and listening skills offline and online. With Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), the English learning process can now be interactive and productive. The students can now improve their language skills by conversing with AI-based agents instead of native speakers to avoid any fear and anxiety. The intelligent platforms can understand the consuming power of the student and hence can create and give content according to their level to create an individualized learning environment. With the help of digital assistants, people can also find it very easy and productive to improve English proficiency. To accomplish the goal of English teaching very easily and ideally, the teachers should use AI-based techniques in the classrooms. With the help of intelligent assistants for the daily workload of a teacher, we will be able to concentrate fully on the language learning and skills of the students. The current study has presented a detailed overview of 5G and AI’s role in research and transformation of English situational teaching in higher studies. The search results are compiled and presented with different details of the area.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The skin is a high turnover organ, and its constant renewal depends on the rapid proliferation of its progenitor cells. The energy requirement for these metabolically active cells is met by mitochondrial respiration, an ATP generating process driven by a series of protein complexes collectively known as the electron transport chain (ETC) that is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide, singlet oxygen, peroxides are inevitably produced during respiration and disrupt macromolecular and cellular structures if not quenched by the antioxidant system. The oxidative damage caused by mitochondrial ROS production has been established as the molecular basis of multiple pathophysiological conditions, including aging and cancer. Not surprisingly, the mitochondria are the primary organelle affected during chronological and UV-induced skin aging, the phenotypic manifestations of which are the direct consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, deletions and other aberrations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are frequent in photo-aged skin and skin cancer lesions. Recent studies have revealed a more innate role of the mitochondria in maintaining skin homeostasis and pigmentation, which are affected when the essential mitochondrial functions are impaired. Some common and rare skin disorders have a mitochondrial involvement and include dermal manifestations of primary mitochondrial diseases as well as congenital skin diseases caused by damaged mitochondria. With studies increasingly supporting the close association between mitochondria and skin health, its therapeutic targeting in the skin—either via an ATP production boost or free radical scavenging—has gained attention from clinicians and aestheticians alike. Numerous bioactive compounds have been identified that improve mitochondrial functions and have proved effective against aged and diseased skin. In this review, we discuss the essential role of mitochondria in regulating normal and abnormal skin physiology and the possibility of targeting this organelle in various skin disorders.',\n",

The effects of Zfhx3 on the expression of the Nav1.5 channel, and in cardiac excitability, are currently unknown. Additionally, we identified three Zfhx3 variants in probands diagnosed with familial atrial fibrillation (p.M1260T) and Brugada Syndrome (p.V949I and p.Q2564R). Here, we analyzed the effects of native (WT) and mutated Zfhx3 on Na+ current (INa) recorded in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. ZFHX3 mRNA can be detected in human atrial and ventricular samples. In HL-1 cardiomyocytes, transfection of Zfhx3 strongly reduced peak INa density, while the silencing of endogenous expression augmented it (from −65.9 ± 8.9 to −104.6 ± 10.8 pA/pF; n ≥ 8, p < 0.05). Zfhx3 significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of human SCN5A, PITX2, TBX5, and NKX25 minimal promoters. Consequently, the mRNA and/or protein expression levels of Nav1.5 and Tbx5 were diminished (n ≥ 6, p < 0.05). Zfhx3 also increased the expression of Nedd4-2 ubiquitin-protein ligase, enhancing Nav1.5 proteasomal degradation. p.V949I, p.M1260T, and p.Q2564R Zfhx3 produced similar effects on INa density and time- and voltage-dependent properties in WT. WT Zfhx3 inhibits INa as a result of a direct repressor effect on the SCN5A promoter, the modulation of Tbx5 increasing on the INa, and the increased expression of Nedd4-2. We propose that this TF participates in the control of cardiac excitability in human adult cardiac tissue.',\n",

At the same time, entrepreneurship began to intersect with sports, and the results were often productive. Sport is seen as a domain that could inspire entrepreneurship through its principles. The similarities between these two fields have created the perspective of common action in sport and entrepreneurship, and this coexistence has improved during times of social change. After 1989, Romania was confronted with many challenges at the societal level, and sport offered a way to address and to tackle social problems. Through sport, some athletes decided to contribute to issues of individuals or communities. They assumed the status of a social entrepreneur, and developed activities that could inspire others. This paper intends to gather examples of such social entrepreneurship from Romania, and to identify the elements that lead to success. The research takes into consideration case studies from various domains, and this diversity helps us to better understand the challenges of Romanian sport when it interacts with social entrepreneurship.',\n",

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate a number of analytic techniques and biomarkers for their ability to accurately gauge bone and cartilage morphology and metabolism in the medial meniscal tear (MMT) model of osteoarthritis (OA). MMT surgery was performed in rats to induce OA. A dynamic weight bearing system (DWB) system was deployed to evaluate the weight-bearing capacity of the front and hind legs in rats. At the end of a 10-week study cartilage pathology was evaluated by micro computed tomography (μCT), contrast enhanced μCT (EPIC μCT) imaging and traditional histology. Bone tissue was evaluated at the tibial metaphysis and epiphysis, including the subchondral bone. Histological techniques and dynamic histomorphometry were used to evaluate cartilage morphology and bone mineralization. The study results showed a negative impact of MMT surgery on the weight-bearing capacity of the operated limb. Surgery caused severe and extensive deterioration of the articular cartilage at the medial tibial plateau, as evidenced by elevated CTX-II in serum, EPIC μCT and histology. Bone analysis by μCT showed thickening of the subchondral bone beneath the damaged cartilage, loss of cancellous bone at the metaphysis and active osteophyte formation. The study emphasizes the need for using various methodologies that complement each other to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of OA at the organ, tissue and cellular levels. Results from this study suggest that use of histology, μCT and EPIC μCT, and functional DWB tests provide powerful combination to fully assess the key aspects of OA and enhance data interpretation.',\n",

The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and cardiovascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, a stroke, pulmonary embolism or cardiac arrest) within 30 days of surgery. Secondary end-points included surgical site infection, severe nausea and vomiting, and hospital length of stay. Of 10 102 eligible patients, 7 112 consenting patients were enrolled. Three thousand five hundred and forty-three were assigned to the N2O group and 3 569 to the non-N2O group. The primary outcome occurred in 283 (8.1%) patients in the N2O group and in 296 (8.4%) patients in the non-N2O group (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-1.13; p-value 0.64).

A role of ABI3 on oil accumulation was also previously suggested based on a decrease of oil content in seeds of abi3 mutant. However, this conclusion could not exclude possibilities of indirect or pleiotropic effects, such as through mutual regulatory interactions with FUSCA3 (FUS3), an activator of oil accumulation. To identify ABI3 functions independent of the effects of related seed transcription factors, we expressed ABI3 under control of an inducible promoter in tobacco BY2 cells and Arabidopsis rosette leaves. Inducible expression of ABI3 activated oil accumulation in these non-seed cells, demonstrating a general role of ABI3 in regulation of oil biosynthesis. Further expressing ABI3 in rosette leaves of fus3 knock-out mutant still caused up to three-fold greater triacylglycerol accumulation, indicating ABI3 can activate lipid accumulation independently of FUS3. Transcriptome analysis revealed that lipid droplet protein (LDP) genes including OLEOSINs and CALEOSINs were highly up-regulated up to 1000 times by ABI3 in the absence of FUS3, while the expression of WRI1 was doubled. Taken together, our results provide genetic evidence that ABI3 activates oil accumulation with or without FUS3, most likely through up-regulating LDPs and WRI1.',\n",

Other components of global change (climate change, introduced pests, land use changes) are also harming ecosystem functioning by augmenting tree mortality worldwide. Defaunation and increased tree mortality often coincide in many human-altered ecosystems but whether they interact, leading to non-additive effects on ecosystem functioning, remains largely unknown. However, under some ecological circumstances, the decline or extirpation of one species due to defaunation can be neutralized by increases in the abundance of some functionally similar species (i.e. ‘density compensation’). We combined long-term field data with individual-based modelling to investigate the potential interactive effects of seed disperser loss, increased tree mortality and density compensation on seed dispersal in a heterogeneous landscape. Our simulation experiments showed that both stressors markedly limit not only the quantity of seed dispersal but also its quality since the impact on seed dispersal strongly varied among habitat types that differ strikingly in suitability for tree establishment. Density compensation had a marked positive effect on seed dispersal which, however, was largely limited under increased tree mortality. The combined negative effects of defaunation and increased tree mortality on seed dispersal\\r\\nwere lower than the expected additive effect.

Methods   All NEN cases were identified from the Victorian Cancer Registry over four time periods: 1982-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2019. Data collected included primary tumor site, histological grade, gender, overall survival (OS), and place of residence. Incidence data were analyzed with the generation of annual standardized rates (ASR). OS was assessed for the entire cohort and between geographical regions.   Results   The overall NEN population (1982-2019) included 8,106 patients: over 60% grade 1/2 NENs, especially small bowel and colorectal.

Two sand columns were operated in series. The first column simulated the up-gradient side of a groundwater system, was operated under anaerobic conditions, and was continuously fed the target contaminant, PCE (42\\xa0µM). The second column simulated the down-gradient side of the groundwater system and was operated under aerobic conditions, using low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as the dissolved oxygen source.

This study also used batch experiments to compare cDCE removal efficiencies between aerobic metabolism using cDCE as the only substrate, and aerobic cometabolism using methane and cDCE as primary and secondary substrates.

This inhibition effect was not obvious under aerobic metabolism using cDCE as the only substrate.

Descriptive two-phase mixed methods sequential design. The quantitative phase consisted of an online survey sent to all occupational therapists holding an entry-to-practice master’s degree in Quebec, Canada (n\\u2009=\\u20091196), followed by focus group discussions with a subset of participants. Analysis used descriptive statistics and the Framework Approach for content analysis of focus group data. Competencies were theoretically anchored into the Profile of Occupational Therapist Practice in Canada (an equivalent to CanMEDS framework) and we used the Theoretical Domain Framework to collect and describe perceived factors and strategies. Response rate to Phase 1 was 26.5% (n\\u2009=\\u2009317/1196). The communicator, collaborator and professional roles were perceived as highly solicited in practice, valued and were rated more frequently at a higher competency level as compared to the other four roles (expert, manager, change agent and scholar roles). Focus group participants (n\\u2009=\\u200916) mentioned that both individual and organisational factors influence enactment of competencies. Consulting colleagues was the preferred strategy to support the scholar role, often described as foundational for the development of expertise. This descriptive study provides valuable information as to how the seven roles are enacted in practice. Though the scholar role is highly valued by clinicians and organizations, insufficient time is allotted to searching for evidence and reflection in practice. Strategies emerging from the results are mainly directed toward this role with an emphasis on using of peers as a source of evidence. Future studies could explore how contextual factors influence the enactment of competencies across different professions as well as how these evolve over time.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The effects of climate change on forest ecosystems take on increasing importance more than ever. Information on plant traits is a powerful predictor of ecosystem dynamics and functioning. We reviewed the major ecological traits, such as foliar gas exchange and nutrients, xylem morphology and drought tolerance, of Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa, which are major timber species in East Asia, especially in Japan, by using a recently developed functional trait database for both species (SugiHinokiDB). Empirically, C. obtusa has been planted under drier conditions, whereas C. japonica, which grows faster but thought to be less drought tolerant, has been planted under wetter conditions. Our analysis generally support the empirical knowledge: The maximum photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, foliar nutrient content and soil-to-foliage hydraulic conductance were higher in C. japonica than in C. obtusa. In contrast, the foliar turgor loss point and xylem pressure corresponding to 50% conductivity, which indicate drought tolerance, were lower in C. obtusa and are consistent with the drier habitat of C. obtusa. Ontogenetic shifts were also observed; as the age and height of the trees increased, foliar nutrient concentrations, foliar minimum midday water potential and specific leaf area decreased in C. japonica, suggesting that nutrient and water limitation occurs with the growth. In C. obtusa, the ontogenetic shits of these foliar traits were less pronounced. Among the Cupressaceae worldwide, the drought tolerance of C. obtusa, as well as C. japonica, was not as high. This may be related to the fact that the Japanese archipelago has historically not been subjected to strong dryness. The maximum photosynthetic rate showed intermediate values within the family, indicating that C. japonica and C. obtusa exhibit relatively high growth rates in the Cupressaceae family, and this is thought to be the reason why they have been selected as economically suitable timber species in Japanese forestry. This study clearly demonstrated that the plant trait database provides us a promising opportunity to verify out empirical knowledge of plantation management and helps us to understand effect of climate change on plantation forests by using trait-based modelling.',\n",

However, there is no guidance yet on best practices or optimum structural designs that fully utilize the UHPC superior mechanical properties for larger components. The objective of this study is to better understand the overall behavior, failure mechanism, and effect of reinforcement and design details of UHPC bridge columns using detailed finite element modeling. The pushover response of a two-column bridge pier with the typical geometry and gravity loads obtained from a representative California bridge is investigated when UHPC is used instead of conventional concrete for the columns. A detailed sensitivity/parametric analysis is conducted to assess the effect of different steel fiber ratio, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, and steel grades of reinforcement bars on the overall structural behavior of the columns. The total strain crack model, as readily implemented in DIANA FEA, is utilized with user-defined input to model the UHPC constitutive material behavior. The UHPC stress-strain relationships in tension and compression are independently defined using uniaxial curves from the literature. For comparison, the two-column bent of conventional concrete is modeled and used as the reference case to evaluate the relative increase in load capacity of the UHPC bridge columns.',\n",

By constructing a hybrid multifunctional catalyst multi-walled carbon nanotubes/layered double hydroxides composites (CNT/LDHs), the highest lactic acid yield of 88.6 % with 90.0 % selectivity was achieved. The outperformance of CNT/LDHs for lactic acid production from glucose is attributed to the following factors: (i) CNT generate strong heating center under irradiation, providing heat for converting glucose into lactic acid; (ii) LDHs catalyze glucose isomerization, in which the photoinduced OVs (Lewis acid) in LDHs under irradiation further improve the catalytic activity; (iii) In heterogeneous-homogeneous synergistically catalytic system (LDHs-OH-), OH- ions are concentrated in LDHs, forming strong base sites to catalyze subsequent cascade reactions.',\n",

To make equivalent optical properties of silicon nitride films, the refractive index and thickness of the films are fixed at 2.0 and 90 nm, respectively.

Furthermore, two experimental materials (F3 and F4) showed similar effects on NHOF-1 cells compared to the negative control medium.       Significance   The lower monomer release and higher cell viability of some experimental THFM compositions are encouraging. THFM partially replacing HEMA is potentially a suitable alternative for producing biocompatible RMGICs.',\n",

Differences in extracellular and intracellular pO(2) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor tissue were tested using several types of water-soluble paramagnetic media, which localize extracellularly or permeate through the cell membrane. The nitroxide carboxy-PROXYL (CxP) can only be distributed in blood plasma and extracellular fluids whereas the nitroxides carbamoyl-PROXYL (CmP) and TEMPOL (TPL) can permeate cell membranes and localize intracellularly.

Here, we use first-principles calculations to evaluate YN and LaN in their cubic and hexagonal phases. Rocksalt YN and LaN are semiconductors, although we show that LaN differs from ScN and YN in having a direct band gap, which we attribute to its weaker $p\\\\text{\\\\ensuremath{-}}p$ coupling. Both have low electron effective masses. In addition to their rocksalt structures, we evaluate the layered hexagonal and wurtzite phases of YN and LaN. For YN, the wurtzite phase cannot be stabilized, and hexagonal YN is higher in energy than rocksalt YN. In contrast, for LaN, the wurtzite phase is favored, and it is comparable in energy to rocksalt LaN. Wurtzite LaN has a polarization of $0.608\\\\phantom{\\\\rule{0.28em}{0ex}}\\\\mathrm{C}/{\\\\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ (referenced to the centrosymmetric layered hexagonal phase), and a high piezoelectric coefficient ${e}_{33}=1.78\\\\phantom{\\\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}\\\\mathrm{C}/{\\\\mathrm{m}}^{2}$. Interestingly, we find that the polarization of wurtzite LaN may be reversible; we find a relatively small switching barrier of 0.06 eV per formula unit, offering the potential for its use as a ferroelectric. Since wurtzite LaN is closely lattice matched to InP, we investigate a heterostructure between (0001) wurtzite LaN and (111) zinc-blende InP, and find the polarization discontinuity would yield a bound charge of $1.3\\\\ifmmode\\\\times\\\\else\\\\texttimes\\\\fi{}{10}^{14}\\\\phantom{\\\\rule{0.16em}{0ex}}e/{\\\\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$, offering the potential for novel electronic applications such as tunnel junctions.

GRO-α is a chemokine, which is overexpressed in many tumor entities and associated with malignant transformation. However, little is known about the expression and function of GRO-α in human cSCC.       Objective   Our aim was to investigate the relevance of the GRO-α (CXCL-1)/ CXCR2 axis in human cSCC and the potential impact of sirolimus.       Methods   We analyzed the GRO-α expression in human keratinocytes, different cSCC cell lines as well as cSCC tissue and investigated its effect on cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, we incubated cells with sirolimus and measured the expression of GRO-α and its receptor CXCR2.       Results   We showed that both constitutive as well as induced GRO-α expression is higher in in cSCC cell lines compared to keratinocytes and that GRO-α protein is detectable in human cSCC tissue. By GRO-α exposure and shRNA knock down, we identified GRO-α as a driving factor in proliferation and migration. Moreover, in a dermis equivalent GRO-α knocked down cSCC cell lines displayed a reduced capacity in tumor nest formation. Incubation with sirolimus significantly inhibited GRO-α expression in keratinocytes as well as tumor cell lines. Moreover, sirolimus decreased the expression of the corresponding receptor CXCR2.       Conclusion   Taken together, our results suggest that the GRO-α/CXCR2 axis plays a role in human keratinocyte carcinogenesis and might represent a molecular mechanism for the preventive effect of mTOR inhibitors in cSCC development.',\n",

No country can achieve sustainable economic development without substantial investment in human capital. In Spain, school failure represents one of the main problems in the educational system, with potentially dramatic consequences for the basic competences required in the labour market and job instability, with the risk of economic and social exclusion. In this paper, we aim to identify the factors that define the risk of school failure in Madrid (Spain) by applying logit models. In this process we use a definition of school failure risk which relates to the probability of scoring below level 2 in the evaluation of competences (diagnostic assessment), and we use grade retention as a proxy of school failure. The variables included in the model cover several areas, such as personal, family and school characteristics. The results show that it is important that the policies to strengthen the educational system begin with early childhood education, as educational delay symptoms are detected, and it is necessary to intensify efforts towards personalized assistance to help identify potential learning problems, especially in those groups in the worst socioeconomic situations, which are most at risk of school failure.',\n",

Initial observations show that especially among younger vaccinated people side effects are common. In this study, using the example of clinic employees, the self-perceived well-being after the first and second dose of the vaccine was examined.   Methods     Anonymized online questionnaire to be filled out once by all employees after the second dose of BNT162B2 was offered. The severity of side effects was queried using an ordinal numerical rating scale with values between 0 and 10. Other key data points were age, gender, and occupational group. The ability to work in the days following the injections was recorded by self-reporting.   Results     Data from 555 respondents were evaluated. The mean age was 40.25 years (standard deviation 12.35). 56 % of the respondents were female, 44.3 % belonged to the medical service, 42.9 % to the nursing service and 12.8 % were assigned to other professional groups with COVID-19 patient contact. Around 2 % of all employees did not experience any side effects at all. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site. Fatigue, headaches and myalgia followed with decreasing frequency. After the first dose, ¾ of the respondents said they had tolerated the vaccination well overall, after the second dose it was only half. After the first dose, over 90 % of the respondents felt that they were able to work again on the following day, after the second dose one third stated that they were only able to work again on the second day. 2.2 % of all employees had to report that they were unable to work for at least one day after the first dose and 19.5 % after the second dose.   Conclusions     Vaccination with BNT162B2 frequently leads to side effects, especially after the second dose. Perception of side effects resulted in 19 % of those questioned being sick after the second dose. Nevertheless, 95 % of all respondents would choose a coronavirus vaccination again.',\n",

Methods Associations between tumor KRAS mutation status (wild-type, G13D, G12V, or other mutations) and progression-free survival (PFS), survival, and response were investigated in pooled data from 1,378 evaluable patients from the CRYSTAL and OPUS studies. Multivariate analysis correcting for differences in baseline prognostic factors was performed. Results Of 533 patients (39%) with KRAS-mutant tumors, 83 (16%) had G13D, 125 (23%) had G12V, and 325 (61%) had other mutations. Significant variations in treatment effects were found for tumor response (P .005) and PFS (P.046) in patients with G13D-mutant tumors versus all other mutations (including G12V). Within KRAS mutation subgroups, cetuximab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone significantly improved PFS (median, 7.4 v 6.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; P .039) and tumor response (40.5% v 22.0%; odds ratio, 3.38; P .042) but not survival (median, 15.4 v 14.7 months; HR, 0.89; P .68) in patients with G13D-mutant tumors. Patients with G12V and other mutations did not benefit from this treatment combination. Patients with KRAS G13D‐mutated tumors receiving chemotherapy alone experienced worse outcomes (response, 22.0% v 43.2%; odds ratio, 0.40; P .032) than those with other mutations. Effects were similar in the separate CRYSTAL and OPUS studies. Conclusion The addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy seems to benefit patients with KRAS G13D‐mutant tumors.

The time now seems right to adapt clinical practice guidelines in such a way that both the professional's perspective as care provider and the patients' preferences and characteristics are being weighed equally in the decision-making process. We hypothesise that clinical practice guidelines can be adapted to facilitate the integration of individual patients' preferences in clinical decision making. This research protocol asks two questions: How should clinical practice guidelines be adapted to elicit patient preferences and to support shared decision making? What type of clinical decisions are perceived as most requiring consideration of individual patients' preferences rather than promoting a single best choice? Stakeholders' opinions and ideas will be explored through an 18-month qualitative study. Data will be collected from in-depth individual interviews. A purposive sample of 20 to 25 key-informants will be selected among three groups of stakeholders: health professionals using guidelines (e.g., physicians, nurses); experts at the macro- and meso-level, including guideline and decision aids developers, policy makers, and researchers; and patient representatives. Ideas and recommendations expressed by stakeholders will be prioritized by nominal group technique in expert meetings. One-for-all guidelines do not account for differences in patients' characteristics and for their preferences for medical interventions and health outcomes, suggesting a need for flexible guidelines that facilitate patient involvement in clinical decision making. The question is how this can be achieved. This study is not about patient participation in guideline development, a closely related and important issue that does not however substitute for, or guarantee individual patient involvement in clinical decisions. The study results will provide the needed background for recommendations about potential effective and feasible strategies to ensure greater responsiveness of clinical practice guidelines to individual patient's preferences in clinical decision-making.\",\n",

The high rigidity and versatility of DNA tetrahedrons means they are often used in biosensing systems. Inspired by \"radar\" technology, we proposed a radar-like monitor to detect RNase H activity in vitro and in situ by integrating DNA tetrahedral elements. The structure of a radar-like monitor was self-assembled from five customized single nucleic acid strands. Four DNA strands were assembled as DNA tetrahedrons with a long strand labeled by Dabcyl (quencher) at one of the apexes, while the fifth strand (DNA-RNA heterozygous strand) was labeled with a FAM (Fluorophore) hybrid with a long strand. The fluorescence was quenched because the fluorophore and the quencher were very close. In the presence of RNase H, the RNA chain was hydrolyzed and the fluorophore released, resulting in fluorescence recovery. The radar-like monitor was used to detect the RNase H activity in vitro with a detection limit of 0.01 U mL-1. Based on the RNase H activity detection and the inhibitory effect of natural-compounds-targeting RNase H, three inhibitors were obtained among 35 compounds extracted from Panax japonicus. Therefore, the radar-like monitor was successfully used to detect RNase H activity in situ due to the long-term anti-DNase I effect of the RNA/DNA hybrid structure and DNA tetrahedrons structure. Overall, this radar-like monitor can effectively avoid false-positive signals and significantly improve the accuracy, precision, and reliability of detection. It is expected that the development of such an intelligent nano-platform will open the door to cancer diagnosis and treatment in clinical systems.',\n",

The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) effect has received decades of study, and is well understood in relatively simple decisions: collecting more evidence before making a decision allows one to be more accurate but also slower. The SAT in more complex paradigms has been given less attention, largely due to limits in the models and statistics that can be applied to such tasks. Here, we have conducted the first analysis of the SAT in multiple signal processing, using recently developed technologies for measuring capacity that take into account both response time and choice probability. We show that the primary influence of caution in our redundant-target experiments is on the threshold amount of evidence required to trigger a response. However, in a departure from the usual SAT effect, we found that participants strategically ignored redundant information when they were forced to respond quickly, but only when the additional stimulus was reliably redundant. Interestingly, because the capacity of the system was severely limited on redundant-target trials, ignoring additional targets meant that processing was more efficient when making fast decisions than when making slow and accurate decisions, where participants' limited resources had to be divided between the 2 stimuli.\",\n",

To accomplish this, we first apply a model based on the Input-Output methodology to quantify the output arisen from the consumption demand to meet the dependency needs covered by LTC spending in 2009, 2012 and 2015. Using the results of this model, we carry out a Structural Decomposition Analysis to explore the main drivers of change in the Spanish economic production for 2009–2012 and 2012–2015. The findings reveal that LTC demand factors have proven more relevant than technology factors in increasing production for the two periods considered. Such findings might guide political decision-making on the management of the LTC system in Spain, showing that public LTC spending does not merely contribute to the welfare of dependents, but also may boost economic production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Silicon quantum dot (QD)-based ‘all-silicon’ tandem solar cells have emerged as a promising third generation photovoltaic approach to realize high-efficiency and cost effective solar cells. This approach exploits the quantum confinement effect of silicon QDs embedded in a dielectric matrix to engineer the effective electronic bandgap of a solar cell material. Research work in our group has shown that such a Si QD solar cell can be fabricated by co-sputtering of thin layers of Si-rich dielectric sandwiched between stoichiometric dielectric layers which crystallize to form Si QDs of uniform size on annealing. The Si-richness in the Si-rich layer plays an important role in formation of uniform size and shape. The matrix and barrier layer materials also affect the formation of Si QDs. The bandgap tunability of such Si QD superlattice structures has been clearly demonstrated by photoluminescence and electroluminescence measurements. Doping of Si QD layers has been achieved by impurity incorporation of P, Sb or B in the Si-rich layers. Strong evidence of effective doping has been demonstrated from the enhanced conductivity, from the dopant concentrations extracted from MOS structures and from the formation of rectifying p–n junctions which give an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 492\\xa0mV. The doping mechanism is more likely to be modified interface doping rather than direct doping to the Si QDs.',\n",

In the intercellular spaces the pathogen proliferates in the apoplastic fluid and forms microcolonies (biofilms) around plant cells. If the pathogen can suppress the plant’s natural resistance response, it will cause halo blight disease. The process of resistance suppression is fairly well understood, but the mechanisms used by the pathogen in colonisation are less clear. We hypothesised that we could apply in vitro genetic screens to look for changes in motility, colony formation, and adhesion, which are proxies for infection, microcolony formation and cell adhesion. We made transposon (Tn) mutant libraries of Pph strains 1448A and 1302A and found 106/1920 mutants exhibited alterations in colony morphology, motility and biofilm formation. Identification of the insertion point of the Tn identified within the genome highlighted, as expected, a number of altered motility mutants bearing mutations in genes encoding various parts of the flagellum. Genes involved in nutrient biosynthesis, membrane associated proteins, and a number of conserved hypothetical protein (CHP) genes were also identified. A mutation of one CHP gene caused a positive increase in in planta bacterial growth. This rapid and inexpensive screening method allows the discovery of genes important for in vitro traits that can be correlated to roles in the plant interaction.',\n",

Beetroot peel’s bioactive compounds and their role in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are still under-researched. In the present study, beetroot peel methanol extract (BPME) was prepared, and its effect on the bio-efficacy, nuclear integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and vascular cell growth, and immunoregulation-related gene expression levels in HUVECs with induced oxidative stress were analysed. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) results confirmed that BPME contains 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (32.6%), methyl pyruvate (15.13%), furfural (9.98%), and 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-Pyran-4-one (12.4%). BPME extract effectively enhanced cell proliferation and was confirmed by MTT assay; the nuclear integrity was confirmed by propidium iodide (PI) staining assay; the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was confirmed by JC-1 staining assay. Annexin V assay confirmed that BPME-treated HUVECs showed 99% viable cells, but only 39.8% viability was shown in HUVECs treated with H2O2 alone. In addition, BPME treatment of HUVECs for 48 h reduced mRNA expression of lipid peroxide (LPO) and increased NOS-3, Nrf-2, GSK-3β, GPX, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular cell growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression levels. We found that BPME treatment decreased proinflammatory (nuclear factor-κβ (F-κβ), tissue necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) and vascular inflammation (intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), EDN1, IL-1β)-related mRNA expressions. In conclusion, beetroot peel treatment effectively increased vascular smooth cell growth factors and microtubule development, whereas it decreased vascular inflammatory regulators.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to establish an effective molecular-based cryoprotectant for SSC cryopreservation via autophagy modulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS To determine the efficacy of autophagy modulation, we assessed the recovery rate and relative proliferation rate and performed western blotting for the determination of autophagy flux, immunocytochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SSC characterization, and spermatogonial transplantation for in vivo SSC functional activity. RESULTS The results showed that a basal level of autophagy caused a higher relative proliferation rate (pifithrin-μ 0.01 μM, 184.2 ± 11.2%; 3-methyladenine 0.01 μM, 175.3 ± 10.3%; pifithrin-μ 0.01 μM + 3-methyladenine 0.01 μM, P3, 224.6 ± 22.3%) than the DMSO control (100 ± 6.2%). All treatment groups exhibited normal characteristics, suggesting that these modulators could be used as effective cryoprotectants without changing the properties of the undifferentiated germ cells. According to the results of the in vivo spermatogonial transplantation assay, the colonies per total number of cultured SSCs was significantly higher in the pifithrin-μ 0.01 μM (1596.7 ± 172.5 colonies), 3-methyladenine 0.01 μM (1522.1 ± 179.2 colonies), and P3 (1727.5 ± 196.5 colonies) treatment groups than in the DMSO control (842.8 ± 110.08 colonies), which was comparable to that of the fresh control (1882.1 ± 132.1 colonies). DISCUSSION A basal level of autophagy is more essential for resilience in frozen SSCs after thawing, rather than the excessive activation or inhibition of autophagy. CONCLUSION A basal level of autophagy plays a critical role in the pro-survival response of frozen SSCs after thawing; herein, a new approach by which SSC cryoprotective efficiency can be improved was identified.',\n",

The present work further extends the approach to soft contact interaction for non-circular rigid bodies rolling on soft material which is difficult to model otherwise. An elliptical disc is taken as the non-circular rigid body as an example. An algorithm is developed to detect nodes of the soft material which contact the disc at any time. The contact interface between the two surfaces is assumed to be viscoelastic which is the penalty approach with additional dissipation. The model is applicable for all geometries of the rigid body. The contact model also takes normal force and tangential frictional force into account. The model dynamically determines the number of contact nodes, and hence the contact area at any time as the contact interface changes. Results of simulation of the model, based on code generated algorithmically from the bond graph structure, provide better understanding of the soft contact interaction issues involved.',\n",

The addition of each chromosome of B. oleracea to the chromosome complement of B. rapa results in a series of monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs). Analysis of MAALs determines which B. oleracea chromosomes carry genes controlling specific phenotypic traits, such as seed colour. Yellow-seeded oilseed rape is a desirable breeding goal both for food and livestock feed end-uses that relate to oil, protein and fibre contents. The aims of this study included developing a missing MAAL to complement an available series, for studies on seed colour control, chromosome homoeology and assignment of linkage groups to B. oleracea chromosomes. † Methods A new batch of B. rapa–B. oleracea aneuploids was produced to generate the missing MAAL. Seed colour and other plant morphological features relevant to differentiation of MAALs were recorded. For chromosome characterization, Snow’s carmine, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) were used. † Key Results The final MAAL was developed. Morphological traits that differentiated the MAALs comprised cotyledon number, leaf morphology, flower colour and seed colour. Seed colour was controlled by major genes on two B. oleracea chromosomes and minor genes on five other chromosomes of this species. Homoeologous pairing was largely between chromosomes with similar centromeric positions. FISH, GISH and a parallel microsatellite marker analysis defined the chromosomes in terms of their linkage groups. †Conclusions A complete set of MAALs is now available for genetic, genomic, evolutionary and breeding perspectives. Defining chromosomes that carry specific genes, physical localization of DNA markers and access to established genetic linkage maps contribute to the integration of these approaches, manifested in the confirmed correspondence of linkage groups with specific chromosomes.

This study digs into the drivers leading European cities in setting ambitious GHG reduction targets by 2030. A total number of 246 local action plans, accepted in the Covenant of Mayors initiative, were evaluated, and ambitious municipalities (with reduction targets over 50%) were compared against those committing to regular targets (40–50%).   Results show that the key factor enabling a higher climate ambition in cities is to develop local mitigation actions in line with the results of the baseline emission inventory, focusing on implementing actions in the most emitting sectors of activity. Furthermore, the study reveals the abilities of specific cities to set highly ambitious mitigation targets: to municipalise energy facilities increasing renewable energy production, and to be able of developing mitigation actions even tackling highly emitting sectors (e.g., transport) that traditionally are not under the competence of local governments.   The study also shows other easy-to-reach solutions that every local authority can take into account to increase its ambition such as developing in-house action plans and conducting a deep stakeholder engagement and participatory processes from the initial stage of the action plan development.',\n",

Our objective was to investigate gender differences in the prevalence of opioid misuse and use disorder in the US over the 5-year period from 2015 to 2019.       Methods   We used annual survey data from the 2015–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to estimate gender differences in the prevalence of opioid misuse. We examined past-year opioid analgesic misuse initiation, opioid analgesic misuse, heroin use, opioid analgesic use disorder and heroin use disorder. Logistic regression models were used to test gender differences, adjusting for sociodemographic variables.       Results   In adjusted analyses, women had higher odds of having initiated opioid analgesic misuse in the past year compared to men. In contrast, men had higher odds of misuse of opioid analgesics, heroin use, and an opioid analgesic or heroin use disorder.       Conclusions   Although opioid misuse has historically been more prevalent in men, the gender difference in opioid analgesic misuse continues to narrow, with more women initiating misuse than men including higher rates of misuse in adolescent girls. Heroin use continues to be approximately twice as common in men as women.',\n",

We aimed to compare bronchial ciliary function and epithelial ultrastructure of COPD patients to healthy controls and explore its relationship to exacerbator phenotypes (frequent [FE] and infrequent [IFE] exacerbator). In this cross-sectional study, 16 COPD patients and 12 controls underwent bronchial brushings. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and dyskinesia index (DI; % of dyskinetic cilia) were assessed using digital high-speed video microscopy, and epithelial ultrastructure using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Bronchial epithelium in COPD showed lower CBF and higher DI, compared to controls (median [IQR] CBF: 6.8 (6.1-7.2) Hz vs 8.5 (7.7-8.9) Hz, p<0.001 and DI: 73.8 (60.7-89.8) % vs 14.5 (11.2-16.9) %, p<0.001, respectively). This was true for FE and IFE phenotypes of COPD, which were similar in terms of bronchial CBF or DI. Subgroup analyses demonstrated lower CBF and higher DI in FE and IFE COPD phenotypes compared to controls, irrespective of smoking status. TEM showed more loss of cilia, extrusion of cells, cytoplasmic blebs and dead cells in COPD patients versus controls. Profound dysfunction of bronchial cilia is a feature of COPD irrespective of exacerbation phenotype and smoking status, which is likely to contribute to poor mucus clearance in COPD.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1963695 .',\n",

Both components are derived from vegetable oil fatty acids. Morphology and macroscopic properties of the blends are analyzed by cloud point, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), rheometry and time-resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments. The adhesion is assessed by T-peel tests of polypropylene web/adhesive/polyethylene film stacks.   In the polyamide matrix, the supramolecular polymer plays the dual role of (1) reinforcing filler at room temperature and (2) plasticizer for temperatures above the melting point. Furthermore, the hot-melts blends show a more abrupt softening behaviour on heating and accelerated hardening on cooling. The significant improvement in adhesion properties (up to a 6-fold increase in the peeling force) can be explained by the crystallisation of the supramolecular polymer in the blends.   As a consequence, the amount of adhesive for a given application as well as the temperature, energy and time needed to process it can be decreased significantly.',\n",

Crystal structure analysis suggests that Bcr30–63 is the core of the Bcr–Abl oligomerization interface for aberrant kinase activity; however, the precise role of other residues of Bcr1–72 excluding Bcr30–63 have not been evaluated. In this study, Bcr30–63 was named OD2 and other residues of Bcr1–72 were named OD1. Cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) was used to carry molecules into cytoplasm. CTP-OD1 and CTP-OD2 fusion peptides were expressed from a cold-inducible expression system. Our results demonstrated that both fusion peptides could localize into the cytoplasm, specifically interact with the Bcr–Abl protein and further inhibit growth, induce apoptosis, and decrease the phosphorylation of Bcr–Abl in K562 cell lines. However, the viability of THP-1, a Bcr–Abl negative cell line, was unaffected. These results suggested that CTP-OD1 and CTP-OD2 may be an attractive therapeutic option to inhibit the activation of Bcr–Abl kinase in CML.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Polyhalogenated carbazoles (PHCZs) were recently discovered in Great Lakes sediment and other aquatic systems. However, knowledge about their bioaccumulation and potential risks to fish and wildlife remains very limited. The present study investigated PHCZs in Great Lakes lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush) and walleye ( Sander vitreus; Lake Erie only) composites collected between 2004 and 2016. Median concentrations of ∑PHCZs by lake ranged from 54.7 to 154 ng/g lipid weight or lw (6.8-28.0 ng/g wet weight). Dominant congeners included 3,6-dichlorocarbazole, 1,3,6-tribromocarbazole, and 1,3,6,8-tetrachlorocarbazole. The highest ∑PHCZs concentrations were found in Lakes Michigan and Ontario fish, followed by Lake Huron, whereas Lakes Erie and Superior fish contained the lowest concentrations. Congener profiles of PHCZs also exhibited spatial variations. After age normalization to minimize fish age influence on bioaccumulation rates, fish ∑PHCZs' concentrations declined significantly over time in all lakes except Lake Erie, with slopes ranging from -10.24% to -3.85% per year. The median toxic equivalent (TEQ) of PHCZs due to their dioxin-like activity was determined to range from 8.7 to 25.7 pg/g lw in Great Lakes fish. This study provides the first insight into the bioaccumulation and spatiotemporal trends of PHCZs in Great Lakes and suggests the need for further research on this group of chemicals.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Very few nosographic entities of neurosurgical interest as Sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts arise doubt about their best management, especially when these lesions are incidentally discovered in asymptomatic subjects. Currently, the debate, as demonstrated by the papers published in this issue of Child’s Nervous System, seems to concern the most appropriate surgical technique and, more precisely, whether temporal arachnoid cysts should be approached endoscopically rather than by craniotomy and microsurgical manipulation. Apparently, both techniques assure similar rates of successes, failures, and complications. In my opinion, however, the discussion should address a more fundamental question that is whether the past experience has provided a sound demonstration that the surgical excision is necessary or, at least, advantageous in all the cases, including the asymptomatic ones. To be less controversial, I would at least discuss whether past failures in the management of these lesions have allowed to individuate reliable criteria to distinguish those subjects who may benefit of the surgical management from those who should be only observed. Sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts, commonly denominated temporal cysts, are characterized by some peculiar features which differentiate them from the analogous lesions developing in other intracranial or intraspinal locations. Besides to be often recognized in asymptomatic subjects, these cysts when associated to symptoms and signs have been reported in conjunction with a so large variety of clinical pictures that is logical to wonder whether the combination is really depending on a cause–effect relationship. Indeed, besides “traditional” clinical manifestations, namely headache, increased intracranial pressure, epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, and intracranial bleeding, considered to be the typical presentation of this type of malformation are attention deficit, hyperactivity, maniac depression, schizophrenia-like symptoms, paranoia, psychoses anosmia, Meniere’s disease, and hearing loss have been described in association with this malformation. From a survey published in this journal [1] aimed at analyzing the neurosurgeon’s attitude in case of symptomatic and asymptomatic temporal arachnoid cysts, it was apparent how the propension to operate increased when the symptoms and signs considered to be typical of these cysts were associated to the radiological image of a Galassi grade II temporal cyst (which was utilized to test the approach of several neurosurgeons from various international centers toward this type of lesion). However, when analyzed objectively on the grounds of the literature, the cause–effect relationship of these “classical” clinical manifestations of temporal arachnoid cysts appears to be quite questionable. Indeed, headache, which is reported in about 70% of symptomatic cases, is in most instances aspecific, chronic, unrelated to the cyst volume, or to the compression/distortion of the surrounding cerebrovascular structures. In most of the subjects who undergo intracranial pressure recording, these symptoms appear also unrelated to the intracystic pressure. Moreover, it is impossible to correlate postoperative brain re-expansion to the intracystic pressure. Concerning seizure disorder, the correlation with the presence of a Sylvian arachnoid cyst or the outcome following its surgical excision is uncertain.

Second, a machine learning clustering algorithm has been applied in a very flexible way, thus allowing the discovery of new data groupings. Third, a novel search strategy is proposed in order to obtain non-overlapped patterns. And, fourth, arbitrary lengths of patterns are searched for, thus discovering long and short-term behaviors that may influence in the occurrence of medium-large earthquakes. The methodology has been applied to seven different datasets, from three different regions, namely the Iberian Peninsula, Chile and Japan. Reported results show a remarkable improvement with respect to the former version, in terms of all evaluated quality measures. In particular, the number of false positives has decreased and the positive predictive values increased, both of them in a very remarkable manner.',\n",

The primary goal of this study was to solve the difficulties of distinguishing green apples in similar background areas, such as leaves, by fusing fuzzy set theory and the manifold ranking algorithm (FSMR). First, the original images were roughly enhanced to make apple targets more prominent by using fuzzy set theory in the HSI color space. Second, the specific query nodes were selected for ranking pixels in the whole image to obtain the final recognition results. Then, a series of operations including hole filling, edge smoothing and the mathematical morphology method were carried out to extract the contours of apple targets. Finally, the proposed method was compared with the additional methods based on manifold ranking (MR), saliency detection by self-resemblance (SDSR) and the K-means clustering algorithm. 100 images of green apple targets with different statuses in natural scenes were tested in the experiment. The results showed that the proposed method could effectively extract the real contours and achieve a high degree of coincidence with the edge lines of the targets, indicating that the recognition results were more accurate. Additionally, the average overlapping coefficient was 90.87%, which was 17.34% higher than the SDSR algorithm and 15.98% higher than the K-means clustering algorithm.

The structures of reactants and product were optimised, and thermodynamic analyses were also carried out using the single point energy calculation and frequency analyses. It is noted that the reaction of binding CO2 by DBU and propanol is thermodynamically feasible and qualitatively in accordance with the experimental observations. The results of thermodynamic and kinetic analyses demonstrate that the possible reaction mechanisms can be a two-step bimolecular reaction and a one-step trimolecular reaction. In the two-step bimolecular mechanism, the first step is the formation of intermediate by DBU and CO2, and the second step is the nucleophilic attack of propanol on the intermediate. In the one-step trimolecular mechanism, O and H atoms of hydroxyl in propanol form an O–C bond with CO2 and an H–N bo...',\n",

All paediatric trainees rotating into the Children’s hospital were contacted asking to express interest in mentoring. They were then matched with interested mentees. During induction week, information was provided to both mentors and mentees to explain the programme in further detail. Feedback was collected at two time periods during the 4\\u2009month process. A further programme has been rolled-out and we are currently creating a deanery wide scheme for all Paediatric trainees to access.   Results   A total of 18 mentoring partnerships were matched in the pilot scheme. Feedback for mentees was 4/18 and for mentors 5/15. This did not improve in the follow-up programme where feedback was 4/13 and 6/13 for mentors and mentees respectively.   The feedback received included both positive and negative comments which have been acted upon to improve and develop the mentoring process.

Short sub-picosecond singlet exciton lifetimes are measured in a structurally related series of infrared-absorbing copolymers that consist of alternating cyclopentadithiophene electron-rich “push” units and strong electron-deficient “pull” units, including benzothiadiazole, benzoselenadiazole, pyridalselenadiazole, or thiadiazoloquinoxaline. While the ultrafast lifetimes of excitons localized on individual polymer chains suggest that charge carrier generation will be inefficient, high detectivity for polymer:PC71BM infrared photodetectors is measured in the 0.6 l λ l 1.5 µm range. The photophysical processes leading to charge generation are investigated by performing a global analysis on transient absorption data of blended polymer:PC71BM films. In these blends, charge carriers form primarily at polymer aggregate sites on the ultrafast time scale (within our instrument response), leaving quickly decaying single-chain excitons unquenched. The results have important implications for the further development of organic infrared optoelectronic devices, where targeting processes such as excited state delocalization over aggregates may be necessary to mitigate losses to ultrafast exciton decay as materials with even lower band gaps are developed.',\n",

On the 15th day, rats were sacrificed and plasma and epididymal WAT were collected before and after feeding. Serum glucose levels were not different between both groups after feeding, but insulin secretion in response to feeding was impaired in 5C-fed rats. In the fasted state, serum TG levels were lower in 5C-fed rats than in 15C-fed rats and serum free fatty acid levels were similar in the two groups. Hepatic TG levels were increased in 5C-fed rats compared with 15C-fed rats, while 5C-feeding did not change epididymal WAT mass. In WAT, tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 followed by binding to a p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase after feeding were significantly reduced inWAT of 5C-fed rats than in that of 15C-fed rats. Moreover, insulin-dependent glucose uptake was suppressed in adipocytes isolated from WAT of 5C-fed rats compared to 15C-fed rats. These findings clearly indicate that protein malnutrition decreases insulin sensitivity in WAT. Furthermore, we examined TG secretion from the liver since it also determines hepatic TG levels in addition to de novo TG synthesis in the liver. However, TG secretion rate was not different between the 15C and 5C groups. Taken together with our previous results, under conditions of protein malnutrition, glucose that is not utilized is preferentially incorporated into the liver and converted to lipid. The suppression of insulin signaling in WAT may play important roles in the preferential distribution of lipid in the liver during protein malnutrition.',\n",

Optical absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence study were carried out on the prepared glass samples. Optical absorption revealed the fast character of the growth of CdS nanoparticles in this medium. Photoluminescence spectra showed only one large band with a maximum at almost 740\\xa0nm, which was associated to transitions between energy levels within the bandgap of the CdS nanoparticles. From the steady state and time-resolved measurements, it was suggested that the emission comes mainly from sulfur vacancies inside the nanocrystals and on its surface, which act as deep traps for the photogenerated electrons. The creation of such vacancies was attributed to the loss of sulfur during the glass preparation as evidenced from a chemical analysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. These traps may be also induced by the fast growth of CdS nanocrystals in this matrix or laser exposure during PL measurements. These CdS-doped glasses with an intense absorption in the UV–Vis region and a large emission band with long lifetime and a large Stokes-shift are adequate for luminescent solar concentrators, photocatalytic applications and solid-state lasers.',\n",

Recent activities to provide scientists with tools for expressing in a form of semantic linkages their knowledge, hypotheses and opinions about relationships between available information objects also support this trend.

A molecular docking study was carried out with CDOCKER protocol of Discovery Studio 2.0 to predict the molecular interaction between L-carnitine and HDAC. Here we found that (1) LC treatment selectively inhibited cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro; (2) LC treatment selectively induces the expression of p21cip1 gene, mRNA and protein in cancer cells but not p27kip1; (4) LC increases histone acetylation and induces accumulation of acetylated histones both in normal thymocytes and cancer cells; (5) LC directly inhibits HDAC I/II activities via binding to the active sites of HDAC and induces histone acetylation and lysine-acetylation accumulation in vitro; (6) LC treatment induces accumulation of acetylated histones in chromatin associated with the p21cip1 gene but not p27kip1 detected by ChIP assay. These data support that LC, besides transporting acyl group, works as an endogenous HDAC inhibitor in the cell, which would be of physiological and pathological importance.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper proposes an investment cost recovery based efficient and fast sequential optimization approach to optimal allocation of thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) in competitive power market. The optimization technique has been used with an objective to maximizing the social welfare and minimizing the device installation cost by suitable location and rating of TCSC in the system. The effectiveness of proposed approach for location of TCSC has been compared with some existing methods of TCSC placement, in terms of its impact on social welfare, TCSC investment recovery and optimal generation as well as load patterns. The results have been obtained on modified IEEE 14-bus system. Keywords—Double auction market, Investment cost recovery, Optimal location, Social welfare, TCSC I. INTRODUCTION HE experience of last twenty years tells that electricity companies can be divided into those parts which are still natural monopolies and those parts where it is possible to have competition and to create a market for electricity. This experience is now being used all over the world to create cheaper electricity by means of competition amongst power stations and amongst companies that are in the business of purchasing and reselling electricity. With the increased power demand, more interconnections with limited transmission expansion and enhanced trading activities in the electricity market it has been challenging task to operate the system in an efficient manner. Flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) are considered to be one technology that can benefit the emerging power system in terms of enhancing the system stability, providing better voltage control and increased loading capability of existing transmission systems with possibility to load lines much closer to their thermal limits (1), (2). Recently, there has been growing interest in allocation of FACTS devices for achieving different objectives for transmission network. Gerbex et al. (3) have used a genetic algorithm to seek the optimal location of FACTS devices in a power system. Optimizations have been performed on the location of the device as well as their values. However, in (3) the number of devices to be installed is decided arbitrarily not by optimization. The impact of TCSC on congestion and spot pricing is presented in (4). The paper demonstrated that the TCSC could reduce congestion as well as the losses. References (5) and (6) have proposed optimal allocation methods for TCSC to eliminate the line overloads, where sensitivity index is introduced for ranking the optimal placement. Priority list method for TCSC allocation for congestion management has been proposed in (7).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     As the primary surface type for high-grade Chinese highways, the long-term performance of asphalt pavement can affect significantly transportation efficiency. It has been confirmed that fatigue cracking is one of the major failure modes for asphalt pavement, which can cause a great reduction of asphalt pavement durability. Currently, the fatigue properties of asphalt mixtures are evaluated mainly based on traditional laboratory fatigue tests, such as bending fatigue tests and indirect tensile fatigue tests. However, none of these fatigue test methods can realistically evaluate the fatigue performance of asphalt pavement under the repeated wheel load. To resolve this issue, the model mobile load simulator (MMLS3), which is a small-scale accelerated pavement test device, was utilized to evaluate the fatigue life of six kinds of asphalt mixtures. The fatigue damage variable was defined as stiffness reduction. Based on the small-scale accelerated pavement test, a stiffness reduction model for asphalt mixtures was determined. A stiffness reduction law for asphalt mixtures during the fatigue process was proposed. The stiffness evolution process could be divided into three phases, which are the adaptation phase, the quasi-stationary phase, and the failure phase. A maximum value of the rate of stiffness reduction from the quasi-stationary phase into the failure phase was proposed as the failure threshold. Besides the fatigue life obtained from the failure criteria had a good agreement with the test results. The results from this research can be used as a theoretical reference for evaluating the fatigue life of asphalt mixtures and improving the durability of asphalt pavement.',\n",

PSiNWs were first synthesized by metal-assisted chemical etching, and then seeded in three different ways. After that ZnO nanorods were grown on the seeded surface of PSiNWs using a hydrothermal procedure. ZnO/PSiNW hybrids showed excellent gas sensing performance for various NO2 concentrations (5–50 ppm) at room temperature, and the electrical resistance change rate reached as high as 35.1% when responding to 50 ppm NO2. The distinct enhancement was mainly attributed to the faster carrier transportation after combination, the increase in gas sensing areas and the oxygen vacancy (VO) concentration. Moreover, the p-type gas sensing behavior was explained by the gas sensing mechanism and the effect of VO concentration on gas sensing properties was also discussed concerning the photoluminescence (PL) spectra performance.',\n",

The research has been based on available literature and own research conducted on the sample of Polish companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange. The author’s research could serve as a guide to carry out similar research in the tourist resort. Financial participation programs existing in particular countries differ because of various circumstances in which they are applied, various range and eligibility of employees, though it is possible to find such elements which they have in common. What can be expected is a radical change in workers’ attitudes towards a higher commitment, stronger identification with the company, and as a result taking responsibility for its future. It is even more important in tourist industry (in transnational tourist companies) in a comparison to the traditional one. It can be assumed that the awareness aspect plays here a vital role in the way to a success of the whole company and individual employees’ as well. Unfortunately, this is not a common condition. We can expect that EFP programs generally would have a positive influence on the functioning of the tourist enterprise. However, the effects could be rather social than economic. More rigorous statistical analysis is needed to know more about economic results in tourist industry, unfortunately such studies are not conducted in tourism, so the question in the title is still open.',\n",

Design/methodology/approach–A total of 1527 hand-collected UMA replies from the interlinked stock exchanges of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore for the period of 2015–2017 were analysed using event study and Heckman two-step methods with market and matched control firm benchmarks. Findings–The overall results support the uncertain information hypothesis. The UMA replies with new information were also found to reduce information uncertainty, but not information asymmetry, and they are complementary to investor protection in enhancing abnormal returns. The overall finding suggests that the UMA public query system can be an effective market intervention mechanism in improving information certainty and efficiency. Research limitations/implications–This study provides insight on the effects of news replies and investor protection on abnormal returns, and support for the uncertain information hypothesis. The finding is useful to policymakers and stock exchanges as they seek to understand how to alleviate investors ’anxiety and to create an informationally efficient market. Nevertheless, this study is limited by the extensiveness of the hand-collected UMA replies and also the potential issue of simultaneity-induced endogeneity.

We quantify the current spatial relationship between nature and society, and we include legacy effects from the most recent period of armed conflict and its consequences of forced displacement and land use disruption. The procedure followed provides a quantitative model where a minimum number of socio-economic and political variables explain the variation in land cover. The results represent the relationship between land use intensity and the main socio-economic and political indicators, highlighting a close interaction between landscape configuration, socio-economic structure of local populations, coercive conservation and armed conflict. A simulated post-conflict landscape shows a clear transition gradient towards agrarian expansion and intensification, also in systems where naturalness is a relevant feature. The peace process in Colombia offers opportunities for new schemes of land planning and management, including natural resource governance and policy reforms to improve welfare and resilience of local communities. The results allow to define options for future planning given the possible consequences of socio-political legacy effects yet to fully play out across Colombia.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Records of epidemics acknowledge immunological multi-serotype illnesses as an important aspect of the occurrence and control of contagious diseases. These patterns occur due to antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) among serotype diseases, which leads to infection of secondary infectious classes. One example of this is dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which comprises the following four serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. The evolutionary vaccination game approach is able to shed light on this long-standing issue in a bid to evaluate the success of various control programs. Although immunization is regarded as one of the most accepted approaches for minimizing the risk of infection, cost and efficiency are important factors that must also be considered. To analyze the         n       -serovar aspect alongside ADE consequence in voluntary vaccination, this study establishes a new mathematical epidemiological model that is dovetailed with evolutionary game theory, an approach through which we explored two vaccine programs: primary and secondary. Our findings illuminate that the ‘cost-efficiency’ effect for vaccination decision exhibits an impact on controlling         n       -serovar infectious diseases and should be designed in such a manner as to avoid adverse effects. Furthermore, our numerical result justifies the fact that adopting ADE significantly boosted emerging disease incidence, it also suggest that the joint vaccine policy works even better when the complex cyclical epidemic outbreak takes place among multi serotypes interactions. Research also exposes that the primary vaccine is a better controlling tool than the secondary; however, introducing a highly-efficiency secondary vaccine against secondary infection plays a key role to control the disease prevalence.',\n",

Ten animals each of both sexes were used. Portions of their small intestine were either fixed for routine histologic processing or homogenized and assayed for the hydroxyproline assay. Histological staining reveal that the collagenous distribution of duodenal submucosa and support of the villus core of the ileum is more prominent in the Pangolin than in the Bat. Data from the hydroxyproline colorimetric assay reveals that the Pangolin has significantly (p = 0.00042) higher total collagen content than in the Bat.

The current study purposed to evaluate the protective effect of Pinus gerardiana (PG) seed on oxidative stress induced by diabetes in the liver and serum of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Materials and Methods This interventional study was performed on 36 male Wistar rats. The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (healthy controls, healthy treated with 3% and 6% (PG), diabetic control, diabetic treated with 3% and 6% (PG) doses). After 6 weeks of intervention, weight, glucose, and oxidative stress parameters in serum and liver including total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, total thiol and superoxide dismutase activity were measured. Data analysis was done by statistical software version 16 and Tukey's one-way ANOVA tests. Results Diabetic rats showed significantly higher malondialdehyde and fasting glucose levels (12±1.2 mmol/L) and significant reductions in fasting insulin serum, weight (-37%), and activity of superoxide dismutase enzymes, total thiol groups, and total antioxidant capacity of serum and liver (about +49% in liver and +16% in serum) (p < 0.001) compared with the healthy groups. Oral administration of PG nuts to diabetic rats caused a significant reduction in malondialdehyde and fasting glucose levels (-43%) and weight loss (+15%), and a significant increase in activity of superoxide dismutase enzymes, total thiol groups, and total antioxidant capacity of serum and liver (p < 0.001). Conclusion The present study concluded that PG can decrease fasting blood glucose, improve insulin resistance, reduce weight loss, and improve oxidative stress indices in the serum and liver of STZ-induced diabetic rats.

Hypothesis A: two subpopulations of pre-synaptic CB1R in corticostriatal glutamatergic terminals exist, one forming and another not forming heteromers with A2AR. Hypothesis B: CB1R are predominantly forming heteromers with A2AR. In the case of hypothesis A, the A2AR might be required for CB1R-A2AR heteromeric signaling, whereas non-heteromeric CB1R activity is inhibited by A2ARs. In the case of hypothesis B, up-regulation of A2ARs may perturb heteromeric stoichiometry, thus reducing CB1R functioning. In any case, pre-synaptic striatal A2AR-CB1R heteromers emerge as important targets of the effects of cannabinoids demonstrated at the neuronal and behavioral level.

Flash pyrolysis and combustion experiments were carried out on starch (22\\xa0μm) and cellulose (53\\xa0μm) at temperatures ranging from 973\\xa0K to 1173\\xa0K. The gases generated were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography. In this paper, a semi-global pyrolysis model was developed for reactive systems with low Damkohler number. It is in good agreement with the experimental data and shows that both carbon monoxide and hydrogen are mainly generated during the pyrolysis of the solid, the generation of the latter compound being greatly promoted at high temperature. A simplified combustion model was also proposed by adding two oxidation reactions of the pyrolysis products. In parallel, flame propagation tests were performed in a semi open tube in order to assess the burning velocity of such compounds. The laminar burning velocity of cellulose was determined to be 21\\xa0cm\\xa0s−1.

In these studies, children may have chosen to prioritize other aspects of performance (e.g., a comfortable start-posture) over ESC while still being able to complete the goal of the task. This is a limitation that is inherent to previously used ESC paradigms. To avoid this in the present study, 52 children with and without DCD (aged 5-12\\xa0years) completed a task that requires second-order motor planning for its successful completion. In the hexagonal knob task, children were instructed to grasp and rotate a hexagonal knob. The rotation angle varied in size: 60°, 120°, 180°, and 240° rotations. Both the 180° and 240° rotation conditions required an uncomfortable starting posture for successful task completion. Results showed that children with DCD were less likely to adjust their initial grip in anticipation of the required rotation angle, resulting in more task failures compared with typically developing (TD) children. Based on this finding we conclude that children with DCD experience genuine second-order motor planning difficulties. Analysis of temporal outcomes, showed that initial reaction time increased with rotation angle, but this was less pronounced for children with DCD than for TD children. There were no between group differences in timing of subsequent events. These results suggest that the difficulties of children with DCD are related to the initial planning process, that is, before the start of the movement.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Establishing the links between the composition, microstructure and mechanics of shale continues to be a formidable challenge for the geomechanics community. In this study, a robust methodology is implemented to access the in situ chemomechanics of this sedimentary rock at micrometer length scales. Massive grids of coupled wave dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and instrumented indentation experiments were performed over representative material surfaces to accommodate the highly heterogeneous composition and microstructure of shale. The extensive datasets of compositional and mechanical properties were analyzed using multi-variate clustering statistics to determine the attributes of active phases present in shale at microscales. Our chemomechanical analysis confirmed that the porous clay (PC) mechanical phase inferred by statistical indentation corresponds to the clay mineral phase defined strictly on chemical grounds. The characteristic stiffness and hardness behaviors of the PC are realized spatially in regions removed from silt inclusions of quartz and feldspar. At the microscale shared by indentation and WDS experiments, a consistent chemomechanical signature for shale emerges in which the heterogeneities of the PC are captured by the standard deviations of indentation properties and concentrations of chemical elements. However, these local behaviors are of second order compared to the global trend observed for mean mechanical properties and the clay packing density, which synthesizes the relative volumes of clay and nanoporosity in the material. The coupled statistical indentation and WDS technique represents a viable approach to characterize the chemomechanics of shale and other natural porous composites at a consistent scale below the macroscopic level.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are well established techniques to bridge the gap between the coarse information produced by global circulation models and the regional-to-local scales required by the climate change Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability (IAV) communities. A number of studies have analyzed the relative merits of each technique by inter-comparing their performance in reproducing the observed climate, as given by a number of climatic indices (e.g. mean values, percentiles, spells). However, in this paper we stress that fair comparisons should be based on indices that are not affected by the calibration towards the observed climate used for some of the methods. We focus on precipitation (over continental Spain) and consider the output of eight Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the EURO-CORDEX initiative at 0.44∘ resolution and five Statistical Downscaling Methods (SDMs) —analog resampling, weather typing and generalized linear models— trained using the Spain044 observational gridded dataset on exactly the same RCM grid. The performance of these models is inter-compared in terms of several standard indices —mean precipitation, 90th percentile on wet days, maximum precipitation amount and maximum number of consecutive dry days— taking into account the parameters involved in the SDM training phase. It is shown, that not only the directly affected indices should be carefully analyzed, but also those indirectly influenced (e.g. percentile-based indices for precipitation) which are more difficult to identify. We also analyze how simple transformations (e.g. linear scaling) could be applied to the outputs of the uncalibrated methods in order to put SDMs and RCMs on equal footing, and thus perform a fairer comparison.',\n",

Materials and Methods: Periodontal examination and collection of GCF by extracrevicular method and serum were performed in sixty patients selected randomly and categorized into four groups as Group I (healthy, n = 20), Group II (gingivitis, n = 20), Group III (chronic periodontitis, n = 20) and Group IV (after treatment group, n = 20). SRP was performed and GCF and serum were collected initially and after 12 weeks of treatment. RANTES levels were estimated in GCF and serum samples by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The results of the study suggest that mean concentrations of RANTES in GCF and serum were highest in chronic periodontitis group (Group III) and it differs significantly from that of Groups I, II, and IV. Further, the concentrations of RANTES in GCF and serum increase proportionally with progression of periodontal disease and decrease after SRP. Conclusion: The mean concentrations of RANTES in diseased group were significantly higher than in healthy and after treatment groups. These data indicate that the high GCF and serum levels of RANTES are at significantly greater risk for progression of periodontitis. However, controlled, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this possibility.',\n",

First, an audit partner's past audit failure rate is positively associated with the probability that the current year annual report that he/she audits is subsequently restated. This positive association is more pronounced for engagement partners (i.e., partners who actually conduct the audits) than for review partners (i.e., partners who review the audits). Incorporating audit-partner audit failure rates substantially increases the predictive power for future financial report restatements.

Diet is a modifiable risk factor for both, and its optimisation may reduce post-operative mortality, atrial fibrillation and cognitive decline. In the present study, we investigated the usual dietary intakes of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), emphasising on food groups and nutrients with putative roles in the inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. From November 2012 to April 2013, we approached ninety-three consecutive patients (80% men) undergoing elective CABG. Of these, fifty-five were finally included (84% men, median age 69 years; range 46-84 years). The median BMI was 27 (range 18-36) kg/m(2). The dietary intake items were fruits (median 181 g/d; range 0-433 g/d), vegetables (median 115 g/d; range 0-303 g/d), dietary fibre (median 22 g/d; range 9-45 g/d), EPA+DHA (median 0.14 g/d; range 0.01-1.06 g/d), vitamin D (median 4.9 μg/d; range 1.9-11.2 μg/d), saturated fat (median 13.1% of energy (E%); range 9-23 E%) and linoleic acid (LA; median 6.3 E%; range 1.9-11.3 E%). The percentages of patients with dietary intakes below recommendations were 62% (fruits; recommendation 200 g/d), 87 % (vegetables; recommendation 150-200 g/d), 73% (dietary fibre; recommendation 30-45 g/d), 91% (EPA+DHA; recommendation 0.45 g/d), 98% (vitamin D; recommendation 10-20 μg/d) and 13% (LA; recommendation 5-10 E%). The percentages of patients with dietary intakes above recommendations were 95% (saturated fat; recommendation < 10 E%) and 7% (LA). The dietary intakes of patients proved comparable with the average nutritional intake of the age- and sex-matched healthy Dutch population. These unbalanced pre-operative diets may put them at risk of unfavourable surgical outcomes, since they promote a pro-inflammatory state. We conclude that there is an urgent need for intervention trials aiming at rapid improvement of their diets to reduce peri-operative risks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The salt overly sensitive (SOS) signal transduction pathway is one of the most highly studied salt tolerance pathways in plants. However, the molecular mechanism of the salt stress response in Tamarix hispida has remained largely unclear. In this study, five SOS genes (ThSOS1-ThSOS5) from T. hispida were cloned and characterized. The expression levels of most ThSOS genes significantly changed after NaCl, PEG6000, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in at least one organ. Notably, the expression of ThSOS3 was significantly downregulated after 6 h under salt stress. To further analyze ThSOS3 function, ThSOS3 overexpression and RNAi-mediated silencing were performed using a transient transformation system. Compared with controls, ThSOS3-overexpressing transgenic T. hispida plants exhibited greater reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging capability and antioxidant enzyme activity, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 levels, and lower electrolyte leakage rates under salt stress. Similar results were obtained for physiological parameters in transgenic Arabidopsis, including H2O2 and MDA accumulation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activity, and electrolyte leakage. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ThSOS3 displayed increased root growth and fresh weight gain under salt stress. Together, these data suggest that overexpression of ThSOS3 confers salt stress tolerance on plants by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, improving ROS-scavenging capability, and decreasing the MDA content and lipid peroxidation of cell membranes. These results suggest that ThSOS3 might play an important physiological role in salt tolerance in transgenic T. hispida plants. This study provides a foundation for further elucidation of salt tolerance mechanisms involving ThSOSs in T. hispida.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine remains the best hope to control the global HIV epidemic. So far, the different strategies tried for vaccine development have led to disappointing results. The first attempted strategy involved trying to raise neutralizing antibodies to inactivate the virus and prevent infection. Both of Vaxgen's VAX004 and VAX003 phase 3 trials made use of this approach but ultimately failed. Given the difficulties encountered, the focus then shifted to the cell mediated arm of the immune system, the T lymphocytes. However, the phase 2 STEP study, which was aimed to stimulate cell-mediated immunity, was halted in 2007 because it failed to prevent infection and there was an increased incidence of HIV infection in vaccinated individuals. Many researchers now believe that vaccine candidates need to induce both sustained broadly neutralizing antibodies and a strong cell-mediated response. Therefore, attention is now focused on the prime-boost approach: a DNA or vector vaccine to elicit cytotoxic T cells that destroy infected cells followed by a subunit vaccine to induce neutralizing antibodies. RV144, the largest ever HIV vaccine trial, used a prime-boost combination vaccine, which was shown to be safe and modestly effective. The ongoing RV152 study will provide more information on the modest degree of efficacy of the RV144 vaccine with results expected in 2013. Finally, the ongoing HVTN 505 trial also makes use of the prime-boost strategy and is expected to provide a better understanding of T-cell-based vaccines. In this review, we discuss the results of all the above-mentioned trials and consider whether an HIV vaccine needs to induce both humoral and cellular immunity to be effective.\",\n",

Signatures of diversifying and balancing selection were found in markers representing important biological functions.

Our expectation was that legumes (Fabaceae), a dominant component of the regional flora, would have consistently high leaf N and therefore structure phylogenetic variation in N-related traits. We also expected ecological selection during succession for differences in nitrogen use strategies, and corresponding shifts in legume abundance. We used phylogenetic analyses to test for trait conservatism in foliar and litter N, C:N, and N resorption. We also evaluated differences in N-related traits between old-growth and secondary forests. We found a weak phylogenetic signal for all traits, partly explained by wide variation within legumes. Across taxa we observed a positive relationship between leaf and litter N, but no shift in resorption strategies along the successional gradient. Despite species turnover, N-resorption, and N-related traits showed little change across succession, suggesting that, at least for these traits, secondary forests rapidly recover ecosystem function. Collectively, our results also suggest that legumes should not be considered a single functional group from a biogeochemical perspective.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background : New models of Integrated Care, such as ‘virtual wards’ are being piloted in Newham Community Services, East London NHS Foundation Trust United Kingdom. These services aim to keep people, living with multiple long-term conditions, well at home through the provision of coordinated inter-disciplinary care noting that the total burden of a person’s health expenditure over their lifespan will be concentrated in their last years of life.   Effective care in the community requires comprehensive, safe, person-centred assessments that can be used sensibly by any member of the inter-disciplinary team. This is core to in identifying needs, collaborative decision-making, appropriate use of resources and service provision.   Historically biomedical information has been emphasised over mental, social and in particular personal aspirations in assessments. The ability to organise information from diverse sources and approaches, within a common framework is a necessary, new skill for professionals working in interdisciplinary teams in order to develop partnership in the delivery of goals of care.     Intervention : The Handy Approach is a novel interdisciplinary assessment framework. It was developed in March 2014, after a literature review and a baseline audit showing variation in documenting the aspirations of the people referred for care. This prompted a need for concise assessments that were safe and person-centred. Assessments cannot proceed until capacity to consent to care has been established. The brief framework spans five domains to direct the interdisciplinary assessment towards personal outcomes, highlight risks and to enable coproduced support preparation. These domains are mapped on the five fingers of the hand, as a memory prompt. The domains covered start with the thumb representing cognition, followed by consent (index finger), function (middle finger), setting (ring finger) and wishes/goals of care (little finger). Alerts include: any impairment in cognition, if the person is bed bound, and if they live alone. Person specific hopes for care were elicited through strength based approaches leading with the question ‘What matters to you?’’ The introduction of the Handy Approach was supported by weekly teaching on topics such as advance preparation in dementia; medicine waste; functional trajectories in the last years of life; coproduction and how to build highly functional inter-professional teams. This was delivered in five-minute sessions described as ‘flash teaching’, which was also disseminated by email with links.     Evaluation : This approach was introduced in the East London NHS Foundation Trust from April 2015. The approach was tested using Quality Improvement methodology, in one of four interdisciplinary teams, which takes referrals from local general practices. Stakeholders involved in the evaluation included all members of the interdisciplinary team (comprising: Occupational Therapist; Physiotherapist; Psychiatric Nurse; Care Navigator, Social Worker; Care of the Elderly Consultant, General Practitioner and Community Matron). The aim of the approach was to improve the degree to which people who were referred for integrated care have all five domains of the Handy Approach systematically documented at their first assessment.     Outcomes : Documentation of 110 cases was tracked between 29 March 2015 and 10 February 2016. During this period 63 people [57%] had the Handy Approach framework documented but there was turnover of most of the team members. Each new member was inducted into using the Handy Approach as it is easy to learn. From the 26 November 2015 until 10 February 2016 there was stability within the team. From this point onwards there was sustained use of the Handy Approach both in documentation and in presentation in 25 consecutive cases. During the duration of the intervention over 35 topics were covered in the flash teaching and qualitative feedback from the team suggests that they value this method of learning. Challenges included a predetermined template not enabling notes to be documented in the Handy Approach format and additional information needing coding such as clinical measurements.     Conclusion : Our testing of the framework demonstrates that the Handy Approach can be an accessible tool in the interdisciplinary team to elicit and document the aspirations of people for whom they provide care. Sustaining this work will mean measuring experiences of how goals of care are agreed and delivered and through developing systems to embed timely feedback loops into practice.',\n",

It had been reported to have an anti-colon cancer effect, but the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, the antiproliferative mechanisms of liriodenine were investigated in the human colon cancer SW480 cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that liriodenine notably induced the G1/S phase arrest. The G1/S phase cycle-related proteins analysis illustrated that the expressions of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, CDK4 and CDK6, and of cyclin D1 and A, as well as the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (ppRB) were found to be markedly reduced by liriodenine, whereas the protein levels of the CDK inhibitors (CKIs), p21 and p27 were increased. Moreover, the intracellular nitric oxide (NO) production, protein levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and, p53 were increased. The p53 overexpression was a downstream event of NO production in liriodenine-induced G1/S-arrested SW480 cells, and the up-regulation of p21 and p27 was found to be mediated by a p53-dependent pathway. The inhibition of p53 by pifithrin-α (PFT-α), down-regulation of p21 and p27 by siRNA, or NO reduction by S-ethylisothiourea (ETU) entirely abolished the liriodenine-induced G1/S phase arrest. We concluded that liriodenine potently inhibited the cell cycle of SW480 cancer cells via NO- and p53-dependent G1/S phase arrest pathway. These results suggest that liriodenine might be a powerful agent against colon cancer.',\n",

Two commercially available alcoholic photoinitiators (1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenylpropanone) were reacted with isophorone diisocyanate to form half-adducts and then reacted with Cloisite 93A, an organophilic montmorillonite clay, to form two CoBOC photoinitiators. The CoBOC photoinitiators were integrated into a standard formulation and subsequently ultraviolet (UV) cured. Property characterization thereof (e.g., adhesion, hardness, and flexibility) yielded unchanged or increased properties with the exception of impact flexibility. Finally, the CoBOC photoinitiators were kinetically characterized via photo-differential scanning calorimetry (photo-DSC) within 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDODA). While increasing concentrations of clay additives generally decrease polymerization rates, increasing concentrations of the CoBOC photoinitiators exhibited increased polymerization rates.

Scientists employing such data often lack standardized metrics to evaluate communities in niche space where more than 2 dimensions are involved. To alleviate this problem, we developed a graphing and analytical approach for use with more than two variables, based on previously established stable isotope bi-plot metrics. We introduce here our community metrics as R scripts. By extending the original metrics to multiple dimensions, we created n-dimensional plots and metrics to characterize any set of quantitative measurements of a community. We demonstrate the utility of these metrics using stable isotope data; however, the approaches are applicable to many types of data. The resulting metrics provide more and better information compared to traditional analytic frameworks. The approach can be applied in many branches of community ecology, and it offers accessible metrics to quantitatively analyze the structure of communities across ecosystems and through time.',\n",

The paper will also attempt to explain how did the “Ubaid expansion” contribute to the formation of hierarchical societies in Greater Mesopotamia.

Of 628 episodes with a completed ECAP questionnaire, 621 (98.9%) had data on exacerbations, and 609 (97.0%) had data on health care use. The ECAP score was significantly higher for children experiencing an asthma exacerbation versus those who were not (mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-1.0) and for episodes resulting versus not resulting in an emergency visit (mean difference, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4), systemic corticosteroid use (mean difference, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7), or hospitalization (mean difference, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5). The ECAP score was significantly lower in children treated with fluticasone versus those treated with placebo (mean difference, −0.7; 95% CI, −1.1 to −0.3).   Conclusions   The 21-item ECAP questionnaire, showing high feasibility, internal consistency, discriminative validity, and responsiveness, has the psychometric properties to serve as\\xa0a validated outcome to measure the burden of preschoolers' asthma exacerbations on their caregivers' functional status.\",\n",

Predictor   Unadjusted postoperative urinary biomarkers of AKI measured within 6 hours of surgery.   Outcome   AKI was defined as AKI Network stage 1 (any AKI) or higher, as well as a doubling of serum creatinine level from the preoperative value or the need for post-operative dialysis (severe AKI).   Measurements   Stratified analyses by preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\\xa0≤ 60 versus > 60mL/min/1.73m 2 .   Results   180 (42%) patients with preoperative eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m 2   developed clinical AKI compared with 246 (31%) of those with eGFRs>60mL/min/1.73m 2   ( P   2 -transformed biomarker concentrations, there was a significant interaction between any AKI and baseline eGFR for interleukin 18 ( P =0.007) and borderline significance for liver-type fatty acid binding protein ( P =0.06). For all biomarkers, the adjusted relative risk (RR) point estimates for the risk for any AKI were higher in those with elevated baseline eGFRs compared with those with eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m 2 . However, the difference in magnitude of these risks was low (adjusted RRs were 1.04 [95% CI, 0.99-1.09] and 1.11 [95% CI, 1.07-1.15] for those with preoperative eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m 2   and those with higher eGFRs, respectively). Although no biomarker displayed an interaction for baseline eGFR and severe AKI, log 2 -transformed interleukin 18 and kidney injury molecule 1 had significant adjusted RRs for severe AKI in those with and without baseline eGFRs≤60mL/min/1.73m 2 .   Limitations   Limited numbers of patients with severe AKI and post-operative dialysis.   Conclusions   The association between early postoperative AKI urinary biomarkers and AKI is modified by preoperative eGFR. The degree of this modification and its impact on the biomarker-AKI association is small across biomarkers. Our findings suggest that distinct biomarker cutoffs for those with and without a preoperative eGFR≤60mL/min/1.73m 2   is not necessary.',\n",

Few dictionaries include the word “conclusory,” and those that do have only recently adopted it. The small number of available dictionary definitions that do exist seem to fail to capture the word’s usage in the legal world. This article explores this definitional perplexity. As the word “conclusory” has taken center stage in the procedural plays of civil litigation with the help of the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Ashcroft v.

This article presents original research and data on the historical use of the word and its lexicographical coverage.

Effective interventions for nurse coaching (NC) practice, fair value outcome measurements, and standardization of terms have yet to be determined. As healthcare systems adopt electronic medical records and as nurse coaching practice evolves, it is important to capture and identify NC interventions. The long-term goal is to improve patient-centered practice by using standardized interface terminology and to examine the feasibility of using the Omaha System to represent NC practice. The three aims were to evaluate content validity of NC case studies, test accuracy of NC graduates identifying Omaha System terms for NC interventions, and explore the feasibility of analyzing NC case study data.       Design   This survey research evaluated NC case studies that were developed for this study by the first author and mapped to Omaha System intervention terms.       Sample   Surveys were emailed to 400 graduates of two nurse coach education programs. Nurse Coaches self-reported little to no experience using standardized terminologies for documentation.       Measures   The Omaha System was used to describe the interventions found in the NC case studies.       Results   Across the three case studies, 95.7% of NCs agreed that the case studies were realistic, and 89.3% agreed that they would use similar interventions; NCs identified Omaha System interventions for the case studies accurately 84.3% of the time, and feasibility of analyzing NC practice data was demonstrated through use of case study data in aggregate.       Conclusion   The Omaha System has potential for use as a NC documentation tool and should be considered for development of a standardized, evidence-based guideline for NC practice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'INTRODUCTION The definition of the safest width of healthy renal margin to achieve oncological efficacy and therefore of the safest resection technique (RT) during partial nephrectomy (PN) continues to be widely debated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of positive surgical margins (PSM), loco-regional recurrence (LRR) and renal recurrence (RER) rates after simple enucleation (SE) and standard partial nephrectomy (SPN) for malignant renal tumors. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic review of the English-language literature was performed through August 2016 using the Medline, Web of Science and Embase databases according to the PRISMA criteria. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in those studies that defined the exact anatomical location of recurrence after PN. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Overall, 33 studies involving 11,282 patients were selected for quantitative analysis. At a median follow-up of 43 (SE) and 52 (SPN) months, the pooled estimates of the prevalence of PSMs, LRR and RER were 2.7% (95% CI: 1.5-4.6%, P<0.001) and 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-2.2%, P=0.018), 2.0% (95% CI: 1.4-2.8%, P<0.001) and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5-1,7%, P=0.04), 1.5% (95% CI: 0.9-2.3%, P=0.001) and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5-1,7%, P=0.40) in patients undergoing SPN and SE, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic analysis and meta-analysis demonstrates that SE is noninferior to SPN regarding PSM, LRR and RER rates in patients undergoing PN for malignant renal tumors. Further studies using standardized reporting tools are needed to evaluate the role of resection techniques for oncologic outcomes after PN.',\n",

We review the literature on corporate innovation, discuss a recent metric of innovativeness in culture and present the results of a large-scale survey on said culture within the higher education sector in Ireland. There is a divide between the university and institutes of technology sector, with organisational culture in universities being perceived to be much more innovative than that in institutes, despite these latter being designed to be closer to industry.

Consequently, research on school age children and adolescents has been quite rare. However, during the last two decades, considerable effort has been made to understand the nature of writing processes among schoolchildren. The aim of this paper is to explore writing competence of younger school age children by investigating compound sentences and coordinating conjunctions during the production of a written text. The most important thing in learning how to write is the development of a child's ability to produce and understand complex sentences of various kinds. Coordinating conjunctions are useful for connecting sentences, but compound sentences are often overused and traditionally seem to implicate poor syntactic ability. The examinees were divided in 4 age groups (181 pupils). Each examinee wrote 3 essays, so the whole corpus consisted of 543 texts in total. The analysis of the collected material included two levels: first we identified compound sentences and the number of clauses, and then the type of coordination was determined. The obtained results show the number and type of coordinated constructions which pupils from the first to the fourth grade of primary school produce. Also, coordinating conjunctions indicate the higher level of syntactic complexity of the text they are produced in. This research provides a new insight into syntactic competence of younger pupils in primary school.\",\n",

However, a few studies have shown that, it is primarily formed by the C4 with contributions from C3 and C5. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying the roots of the phrenic nerve and subject it to histological procedure to identify the maximum contribution in its formation.Materials and methods: 20 formalin- fixed adult cadavers of both sexes were used for the study. The necks were dissected bilaterally and the roots of the phrenic nerve were identified, colored and photographed. The transverse section of the phrenic nerve immediately after its formation was taken and subjected for the histological procedures. The sections were stained with osmic acid and photographs were taken.Results: 20% of the dissected necks showed that the phrenic nerve had root value C3, C4, C5 and 55% of the dissected necks had root value C4, C5. Osmic acid stained histological sections confirmed that C4 gives a major contribution to phrenic nerve.Conclusion: The results of the present study are in support of the fact that C4 gives major contribution for the phrenic nerve. This fact helps the surgeons in finding out the exact cause of paralysis of the diaphragm and also help in sectioning the phrenic nerve for the nerve graft in the repair of post cricoarytenoid muscle',\n",

Currently, magnesium-based (Mg) stent devices have remained at the forefront of bioresorbable stent material development and use. Despite substantial advances, the process of developing novel absorbable stents and their clinical translation is time-consuming, expensive, and challenging. These challenges, coupled with the continuous refinement of alternative bioresorbable metallic bulk materials such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), have intensified the search for an ideal absorbable metallic stent material. Here, we discuss the most recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence for the efficacy of bioresorbable metallic stents and material candidates. From this perspective, strategies to improve the clinical performance of bioresorbable metallic stents are considered and critically discussed, spanning material alloy development, surface manipulations, material processing techniques, and preclinical/biological testing considerations.

Zinc(II) binding of an AVB may lead to an emission bathochromic shift of the fluoroionophore without diminishing its fluorescence quantum yield. This observation can be explained using the excited state model of electron donor-π bridge-electron acceptor \"push-pull\" fluorophores, in which the bipy moiety acts as an electron acceptor, and zinc(II)-coordination strengthens its electron affinity. The spectral sensitivity of bipy-containing fluoroionophores, such as AVBs, to zinc(II) can be exploited to prepare fluorescent indicators for this ion. In several cases, AVB moieties are incorporated in fluorescent heteroditopic ligands, so that the variation of zinc(II) concentration over a relatively large range can be correlated to fluorescence changes in either intensity or color. AVB fluoroionophores are also used to introduce an intramolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy for creating zinc(II) indicators with high photostability and a narrow emission band, two desired characteristics of dyes used in fluorescence microscopy.',\n",

The simulation results show the outer (outside of the capillary) and inner (inside of the capillary) curvatures of the droplet can cause two Laplace pressures. The difference between these two pressures forms a net pushing force which directly drives the droplet flowing into the non-wetting capillary. We give a detailed analysis on how the outer and inner curvatures change during the penetration process. To further show the effect of the Laplace pressure difference on the droplet movement, we also simulate a new droplet/capillary/film system. In this system, the droplet and liquid film are placed at both ends of a prefilled capillary. It is very interesting to find that the droplet penetrates even faster in lyophobic capillaries over lyophilic ones, and the spontaneous penetration does not pose any wettability restriction which is different from previous study in literatures.

Therefore, it is important to estimate areca nut use and the exposure levels of areca alkaloids that are responsible for its health effects. China is a major producer of areca nut and has a large number of areca nut chewers. In this study, occurrence of areca alkaloids and metabolites in wastewater of major cities across China was examined via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Arecoline, arecaidine, and their metabolite, N-methylnipecotic acid (NMNA) were detected in the overwhelming majority of wastewater samples, with concentrations up to several μg/L. In contrast, guvacoline was only occasionally detected and guvacine was below detection limit in all samples, possibly due to their low contents in areca nut products, low excretion rates, and/or low stability in sewer systems. Strong positive correlations existed between arecoline, arecaidine, and NMNA concentrations. In addition, their loads were much higher in Central and Southern China. This geographic pattern is consistent with previous survey results on prevalence of areca nut chewing. These results indicate that WBE is a potentially useful method to monitor areca nut consumption and to estimate the exposure levels of areca alkaloids.',\n",

Immune checkpoint blockade of PD-1 alone or combined with other immune checkpoint blockade has gained impressive results in murine AML models by improving anti-leukemia CD8+T cell function, which has greatly promoted the strategy to utilize combined immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat AML patients. However, the expression profiles of these immune checkpoint receptors, such as co-inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIGIT and co-stimulatory receptor CD226, in T cells from AML patients have not been clearly defined. Here we have defined subsets of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood (PB) from newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy controls (HCs). We have observed increased frequencies of PD-1- and TIGIT- expressing CD8+ T cells but decreased occurrence of CD226-expressing CD8+T cells in AML patients. Further analysis of these CD8+ T cells revealed a unique CD8+ T cell subset that expressed PD-1 and TIGIT but displayed lower levels of CD226 was associated with failure to achieve remission after induction chemotherapy and FLT3-ITD mutations which predict poor clinical prognosis in AML patients. Importantly, these PD-1+TIGIT+CD226-CD8+T cells are dysfunctional with lower expression of intracellular IFN-γ and TNF-α than their counterparts in HCs. Therefore, our studies revealed that an increased frequency of a unique CD8+ T cell subset, PD-1+TIGIT+CD226-CD8+T cells, is associated with CD8+T cell dysfunction and poor clinical prognosis of AML patients, which may reveal critical diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and direct more efficient therapeutic strategies.',\n",

Available treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and anticancer drugs are limited due to stage of cancer, side effects and altered biodistribution. The use of peptides extracted from natural products has appeared as a potential therapy. Gloriosa superba is known to contain colchicine and other alkaloids with anticancer activity. However, these peptides contained within the extracts have not been studied. This study, therefore, focuses on an investigation of anti–colon cancer activity from a partially purified protein hydrolysate of G superba rhizome.

Results showed that the germination indicator increased more in M-81E than that in Roma under rehydration. Under drought stress, both the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and oxidoreductive activity (ΔI/I0) of Roma decreased more than those in M-81E. Relative to Fv/Fm, the ΔI/I0 decreased markedly, which indicated that PSI was more sensitive to drought stress than PSII. Increases in the reduction state of QA (1–qp), nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and minimal fluorescence yield of the dark-adapted state (F0) were greater in Roma than those in M-81E; meanwhile, the H2O2 content was lower in M-81E than that in Roma.

The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of using E. arundinaceus 28NG7 as a trap crop to control C. sacchariphagus in commercial field conditions and to assess the susceptibility of E. arundinaceus 28NG7 to the three main sugarcane diseases in Reunion: smut, leaf-scald and gumming.

Using on-station trials, we also showed that E. arundinaceus 28NG7 is tolerant or resistant to the three sugarcane diseases and is, therefore, unlikely to act as a disease reservoir and source of inoculum for contaminating sugarcane. The first step to encourage the use of E. arundinaceus 28NG7 borders in commercial fields described here was also successful in terms of growers’ adoption.

Resection techniques primarily include endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. Resection of nodular disease is generally followed by one of multiple ablative therapies among which radiofrequency ablation has the best evidence supporting safety and efficacy. These advanced endoscopic procedures require both experience and expertise in the cognitive and procedural aspects of EET. However, very few formal programs exist that teach endoscopists the necessary skills to perform EET in a safe, standardized, and efficacious manner. Case volume at both the endoscopist and center level has been shown to affect clinical outcomes based on limited data. As a result, some recent guidelines endorse case volume as a measure of competency. Quality indicators, which can be used as benchmarks for training and as part of pay for quality initiatives, have recently been derived for EET. However, quality metrics in EET have not been widely accepted, nor are they broadly used currently. Although the efficacy of EET for BE is established, there is a need for application of quality metrics to both assure adequate training in these procedures and assess treatment outcomes.

Methods   Participation in an anonymous on-line survey was invited via university databases. Descriptive statistical analysis of quantitative data used a combination of software and manual methods. Qualitative data were manually coded and categorised into themes through inductive reasoning.       Findings   Most experiences of revalidation were positive. Reflective discussions resulted in mutual learning, particularly if partners were chosen by the registrant. External scrutiny was welcomed. Some registrants questioned involvement of line managers and alignment with performance review, seeking to avoid a ‘tick-box exercise’ and conflicts of interest. University staff felt better prepared and more positive than clinicians. Pre-registration curriculum activities preparing students included writing reflections, maintaining portfolios, practice assessment and discussions about the revalidation process. Midwifery students seemed better prepared than nursing peers. Key themes of ‘Professional values’, ‘Preparation’, ‘Process’ and ‘Purpose’ and a range of positive influences and potential hazards informed development of a conceptual model.       Conclusions   The purpose and process of revalidation is enhanced if confirmation is undertaken by a registered nurse or midwife of the individual's choice.

The assessment is performed independently, by analyzing the clinical aspects, severity, therapies, and their effectiveness, as well as the impact on daily life activities and its effect on employment. The FM-Check tool is a subjective scale that can be helpful in jointly assessing all these aspects, and provide professional support in monitoring the patient, as well as contribute to a multidisciplinary approach.       Method   To develop FM-Check is developed by starting with the clinical history in which the variables that are going to be used are defined, and grouped into 4 blocks to which a percentage limitation rate is assigned for each variable and each block. An overall percentage limitation is then calculated for the activities in each person.       Results   The distribution of assigned percentages was: a maximum of 10% for personal appearance, 55% for clinical-therapeutic aspects, 24% for work aspects, and 10% for impact on everyday life.

       "  'abstract': 'In 1981 I established kingdom Chromista, distinguished from Plantae because of its more complex chloroplast-associated membrane topology and rigid tubular multipartite ciliary hairs. Plantae originated by converting a cyanobacterium to chloroplasts with Toc/Tic translocons; most evolved cell walls early, thereby losing phagotrophy. Chromists originated by enslaving a phagocytosed red alga, surrounding plastids by two extra membranes, placing them within the endomembrane system, necessitating novel protein import machineries. Early chromists retained phagotrophy, remaining naked and repeatedly reverted to heterotrophy by losing chloroplasts. Therefore, Chromista include secondary phagoheterotrophs (notably ciliates, many dinoflagellates, Opalozoa, Rhizaria, heliozoans) or walled osmotrophs (Pseudofungi, Labyrinthulea), formerly considered protozoa or fungi respectively, plus endoparasites (e.g. Sporozoa) and all chromophyte algae (other dinoflagellates, chromeroids, ochrophytes, haptophytes, cryptophytes). I discuss their origin, evolutionary diversification, and reasons for making chromists one kingdom despite highly divergent cytoskeletons and trophic modes, including improved explanations for periplastid/chloroplast protein targeting, derlin evolution, and ciliary/cytoskeletal diversification. I conjecture that transit-peptide-receptor-mediated ‘endocytosis’ from periplastid membranes generates periplastid vesicles that fuse with the arguably derlin-translocon-containing periplastid reticulum (putative red algal trans-Golgi network homologue; present in all chromophytes except dinoflagellates). I explain chromist origin from ancestral corticates and neokaryotes, reappraising tertiary symbiogenesis; a chromist cytoskeletal synapomorphy, a bypassing microtubule band dextral to both centrioles, favoured multiple axopodial origins. I revise chromist higher classification by transferring rhizarian subphylum Endomyxa from Cercozoa to Retaria; establishing retarian subphylum Ectoreta for Foraminifera plus Radiozoa, apicomonad subclasses, new dinozoan classes Myzodinea (grouping Colpovora gen. n., Psammosa), Endodinea, Sulcodinea, and subclass Karlodinia; and ranking heterokont Gyrista as phylum not superphylum.',\n",

Moreover US results were correlated with the other patterns of histological alterations (giant cells, calcifications, laminar necrosis). Correlation between variables was done by Rho of Spearman method.   Results   15 patients, 6 males and 9 females (mean age 71.6±7 years – duration symptoms at onset 1.7±1.3 months – mean ESR 60 mm/h ±29 – mean CRP 8 mg/dl ± 5.2) entered the study. US halo sign was bilateral in 10/15 (66,7%). The mean halo thickness was 0.53 mm ± 0.12. Five patients had USG =1, six patients =2 and four patients =3. The hystological inflammatory grade 1 was present in seven pts, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in four pts. No significant correlation were found between USG and histological inflammatory grade, nor with the presence of giant cells, calcifications, laminar necrosis and intima-media thickness.   Conclusions   No correlation has been found between the size of the halo sign and the hystological inflammatory grading.   Disclosure of Interest   None declared',\n",

For example, using classical properties of concrete, like its resistance to compression, should be most effective. In this context it is possible to mention high performance two-layer beams with high strength concrete (HSC) in compressed zone and normal strength concrete (NSC) in the tensile one. This idea was further developed in the frame of the current research from the viewpoint of column – flat slab high performance joint. The joint consists of HSC columns and NSC flat slab. In this case providing appropriate joint ductility becomes one of the most important design requirements, because ductility defines the ability of a structure or its elements to absorb energy by plastic deformations. This study was aimed at complex experimental and theoretical investigation of such joints ductility. Essential contribution to the joint’s ductility can be obtained due to the slab’s confining effect. It was demonstrated that the ductility depends on the joint’s confining effect in two horizontal and vertical directions. The influence of slab load intensity and slab reinforcement ratio on the joint’s ductility is also taken into account. It is demonstrated that the effects of the ratio between the slab thickness and the column’s section dimension, as well as the presence of ties in the joint, on ductility are significant too.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     In the present work, a growing particle subjected to anisotropic effect, if not influenced by other particles, is assumed to be an isotropically growing particle with constant volume. Accordingly, how to describe the anisotropic growth just becomes how to solve the blocking effect arising from the anisotropic growth. Following the statistical description of Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov kinetics, the blocking effect was investigated further. Consequently, a series of analytical models for solid-state transformation, where a particle undergoes 1-scale blocking, k-scale blocking and infinite-scale blocking, were developed. On this basis, it was analytically proved for the first time that the classical phenomenological equation accounting for the anisotropic effect (       f   =   1   -   [   1   +   (   ξ   -   1   )       x       e           ]       -   1   /   ξ   -   1           ) corresponds to an extreme case where a particle encounters infinite-scale blocking. From the model analysis, the anisotropic effect on the transformation depends on two factors: the non-blocking factor γ and the blocking scale k. From the model calculations, the Avrami exponent, subjected to the anisotropic effect, changes as a function of the transformed fraction, whereas the effective activation energy is not affected by the anisotropic effect. The present models were adopted to describe isothermal crystallization of amorphous Fe33Zr67 ribbons; good agreement with the published results was achieved.',\n",

The use of PEG has evolved to be useful in many situations beyond degenerative neuromuscular disorders, with an increasing body of evidence supporting the advantages of PEG tubes in oncologic and pediatric patients. Risk factors for complications after PEG tube placement include acute and chronic conditions associated with malnutrition and several organic disorders. Patients suitable for PEG tube placement should be individually identified to implement the advantages of this technique while minimizing risk events. The safety of placing a PEG tube in patients under antithrombotic medication has been investigated, as well as the advantages of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing peristomal infection. Evidence supports the safety of early feeding after placement, thus resulting in lower costs. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-related complications are rare and mostly prevented by appropriate nursing care. Best medical practice and nursing care will ensure optimal performance leading to a wider acceptance, and greater utility of PEG by healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers.

Blood tests showed an elevated white blood cell count (28.4\\u2009×\\u2009109/L) and hyperamylasemia (505\\xa0U/L). Liver function, renal function, clotting profile, and blood gas were all normal. Chest and abdominal X-ray displayed dilated gastric bubbles without free gas. The diagnosis was acute pancreatitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nEight hours later, the patient complained of aggravated epigastric pain. His condition deteriorated rapidly with development of high fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Repeated physical examination showed apparent peritonitis in the abdomen. Chest X-ray was urgently repeated revealing free gas under the diaphragm.\\r\\n\\r\\nUrgent laparotomy with midline incision was carried out. A liter of turbid peritoneal fluid was gathered. Surgical emphysema was found along the proximal small bowel mesentery, and a small perforation measuring 2\\xa0mm was discovered at the small bowel 10\\xa0cm from the duodenojejunal flexure. Inflammation on the mesenteric side of the proximal jejunum was located; whereas, there was no evidence of inflammation of the main pancreas. Segmental small bowel resection with end-to-end handsaw anastomosis was performed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit after the operation because of severe septic shock. A high dose of infusion was administered to sustain his blood pressure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics piperacillin and tacarcillin which cover Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria were dispensed. Postoperative blood tests indicated leukopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. A second-look laparotomy was carried out the following day but no abnormality was found; however, despite maximal support, the patient's conditions deteriorated and he died 2\\xa0days after the operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistopathological examination of the specimen revealed the presence of pancreatic heterotopia at proximal jejunal wall, associated with acute pancreatitis and secondary bacterial infection resulted from perforation of the proximal jejunum. Gross pathological examination exposed a 2\\u2009×\\u20092\\u2009×\\u20091-cm lobulated mural mass in the jejunum. Histology showed lobules of pancreatic acini and ductules as well as intervening smooth muscle fibers in a fibrous stroma. The mass was accompanied by suppurative inflammation, acute serositis, and focal transmural tissue necrosis. Gram-negative bacilli were also found. The overall picture was consistent with pancreatic heterotopia which was associated with acute inflammation, secondary bacterial infection, perforation, and acute peritonitis. Post-mortem examination was performed and no acute inflammation of the main pancreatic gland was found.\\r\\n\\r\\nA congenital anomaly, heterotopic pancreas is pancreatic tissue existing aberrantly outside its normal anatomical location lacking both anatomic and vascular connections. It usually occurs at the upper gastrointestinal tract, the commonest sites being the duodenum (27.5%), the stomach (25.5%), and the jejunum (15.9%). Unusual locations include the colon, the spleen, the liver, the biliary tract, the mesentery, and lymph nodes. Pancreatic heterotopia is a pathological diagnosis with an incidence estimated to be 0.5% to 15% of all autopsies with male predominance between the ages of 30 and 50.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pancreas is derived from the endoderm by means of fusion of the anterior and posterior pancreatic buds which arise from the caudal part of the foregut. The dorsal portion becomes the body and tail, and the ventral portion becomes the head of the pancreas. There are several hypotheses regarding the formation of heterotopic pancreas including abnormal attachment of pancreatic tissue to new locations at embryological state, abnormal differentiation of multipotent regional endoderm, and incomplete regression of the atrophic left ventral pancreatic bud.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresentation of pancreatic heterotopia depends on the nature and location of a lesion. Patients of pancreatic heterotopia can be asymptomatic or they may have abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, intussusception, jaundice, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or benign tumors with malignant potential. In the worst case, they may die of the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreoperative diagnosis of pancreatic heterotopia is rarely possible regardless of improvements in diagnostic tools and techniques. The majority of patients only present the aforesaid symptoms with a raised amylase level. In a case of high suspicion, endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration can be used to help to confirm diagnosis of the disease. The image of most heterotopic pancreas produced by computed tomography is enhanced brightly similar to the image of orthotopic pancreas; whereas, reduced enhancement of image is a result of necrosis of heterotopic pancreas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs imaging has its limitations, the aforementioned symptoms should warrant an exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy. However, even with laparotomy, sometimes coming to a conclusive diagnosis may be difficult owing to the gross similarity of the lesion of pancreatic heterotopia to other types of tumor lesions, e.g., gastrointestinal stromal tumor, carcinoid, and even gastric carcinoma. Frozen section would be helpful to establish the diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary extensive operations. However, if a definite diagnosis still cannot be reached, in most cases segmental resection will be done so as to avoid reoperation, just like segmental resection for small bowel lesions, Whipple operation in the bile duct, wedge resection in the stomach, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pancreatic heterotopia, if pancreatitis occurs, it is virtually impossible to know without imaging, surgical, or pathological proof whether it is localized in the heterotopic tissue or involves the whole pancreas. The current case has clearly shown that inflammation can occur solely in ectopic pancreas without involvement of the main gland. This may pose great difficulty in the management of the situation because ectopic pancreas is normally very small so usually before signs and symptoms can be seen severe inflammation has already occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn clinical management of pancreatitis, it is advisable to perform an imaging modality by either ultrasound or computer tomography scan to delineate the etiology of the disease within 72\\xa0h after admission for patients with stable conditions. Urgent imaging should be arranged if severe pancreatitis as classified by the Atlanta Criteria develops. In the management of complicated pancreatic heterotopia, more aggressive intervention should be carried out before irreversible systemic results arise. In differential diagnosis for peritonitis, pancreatic heterotopia should be considered. In the current case, the patient suffered not only extensive emphysematous change of the small bowel but also peritonitis caused by perforation of the small bowel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreatment option for pancreatic heterotopia would be radical operation if local excision is not possible. Resection of the portion bearing heterotopic pancreatic tissue is also advisable, and surgical exploration should be done for all symptomatic patients even without definite histological diagnosis.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chip formation in metal cutting is associated with large strains and high strain rates, concentrated locally to deformation zones in front of the tool and beneath the cutting edge. Furthermore, dissipative plastic work and friction work generate high local temperatures. These phenomena together with numerical complications make modelling of metal cutting difficult. Material models, which are crucial in metal cutting simulations, are usually calibrated based on data from material testing. Nevertheless, the magnitude of strains and strain rates involved in metal cutting are several orders higher than those generated from conventional material testing. A highly desirable feature is therefore a material model that can be extrapolated outside the calibration range. In this study, two variants of a flow stress model based on dislocation density and vacancy concentration are used to simulate orthogonal metal cutting of AISI 316L stainless steel. It is found that the addition of phonon drag improves the results somewhat but the addition of this phenomenon still does not make it possible to extrapolate the constitutive model reliably outside its calibration range.',\n",

Nano-sized ferritin and chitosan provide a platform for fabricating shell–core system to encapsulate lutein. Herein, soybean seed ferritin (Glycine max) and chitosan stabilized lutein composites (FCLs) were fabricated by a unique reversible disassembly-reassembly character of apoferritin and ferritin–chitosan interaction. Results showed that lutein molecules were successfully encapsulated within the apoferritin with a molar ratio of 25.2 to 1 (lutein/ferritin), and the encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were 16.8% and 2.50% (w/w), respectively. It was calculated that approximately 10 chitosan molecules were bound to a ferritin with a binding constant of 6.3 × 105 M−1, suggesting electrostatic interaction played an important role in ferritin–chitosan interaction. Results also indicated as much as 74.1% (w/w) of lutein was retained in FCLs after storage at 20 °C for 7 days. In addition, the photo- and heat-stability of lutein in FCLs were greatly improved as compared to free lutein. Furthermore, FCLs exhibited prolonged release of lutein in simulated gastrointestinal tract (GI) digestion as a result of ferritin coating and chitosan binding. Interestingly, food components exerted different effects in lutein release, EGCG, grape seed proanthocyanidin, and milk could inhibit while pectin could facilitate the release of lutein from FCLs. This work demonstrates an innovative strategy to solubilize, stabilize and control release of functional food nutrients.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) constitute a large and structurally diverse family of signaling enzymes that control the cellular levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Malfunction of PTP activity has significant implications in many human diseases, and the PTP protein family provides an exciting array of validated diabetes/obesity (PTP1B), oncology (SHP2), autoimmunity (Lyp), and infectious disease (mPTPB) targets. However, despite the fact that PTPs have been garnering attention as novel therapeutic targets, they remain largely an untapped resource. The main challenges facing drug developers by the PTPs are inhibitor specificity and bioavailability. Work over the last ten years has demonstrated that it is feasible to develop potent and selective inhibitors for individual members of the PTP family by tethering together small ligands that can simultaneously occupy both the active site and unique nearby peripheral binding sites. Recent results with the bicyclic salicylic acid pharmacophores indicate that the new chemistry platform may provide a potential solution to overcome the bioavailability issue that has plagued the PTP drug discovery field for many years. Structural analysis of PTP-inhibitor complexes reveals molecular determinants important for the development of more potent and selective PTP inhibitors, thus offering hope in the medicinal chemistry of a largely unexploited protein class with a wealth of attractive drug targets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nanomaterials have attracted attention because of their unique physical, chemical, and mechanical properties that differ from those of bulk solids and molecules. Nanomaterials exhibit distinct sizedependent properties in the 1–100 nm range where quantum phenomena are involved. That is, when the particle radius approaches the asymptotic exciton Bohr radius, the influence of quantum confinement becomes apparent. The very large surface area of nanomaterials is one of the reasons for their novel properties and the high surface-to-volume ratio results in high significant effects of surface properties on their structure. Intensive research is being done for the use of nanomaterials in many applications such as energy storage, energy conversion, solar cells, pharmaceuticals, life science applications, optoelectronics, sensing and actuation nanosystems, catalysis, and composite materials. The techniques that can be used to characterize nanomaterials include electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopies especially, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, x-ray scattering, x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, acoustic wave technique, contact angle measurements, and various spectroscopies. The following articles describe the production and characterization of different types of nanomaterials, where the morphological, structural, and mechanical properties are determined and discussed. In the article, ‘‘Boron-Doped Strontium-Stabilized Bismuth Cobalt Oxide Thermoelectric Nanocrystalline Ceramic Powders Synthesized via Electrospinning’’ by S. Kocyigit et al. both boron-undoped and boron-doped thermoelectric strontium-stabilized bismuth cobalt oxide nanocrystalline ceramics are produced by an electrospinning technique. The powders are characterized by using x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and physical properties measurement system techniques. The structural and thermoelectric properties of the produced powders are evaluated and the effects of boron doping on the thermoelectric capacity of materials are also determined. In the next article, ‘‘Singleand Two-Layer Coatings of Metal Blends onto Carbon Steel: Mechanical, Wear, and Friction Characterizations’’ by B.S. Yilbas et al., singleand two-layer coatings of metal blends onto carbon steel are produced using a high-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) deposition gun. The wear and friction resistance of super alloy powder coatings are investigated. The surface mechanical properties and the nanomechanical properties of singleand two-layer coatings are measured using the nanoindentation technique. The residual stresses formed on the surface of the coatings are measured using the x-ray diffraction technique. They found that the mechanical properties, friction, and wear resistance of the two-layer coating are similar to that of the single-layer coating. The synthesis and characterization of new and novel nanomaterials with well-controlled structures, crystalline phases, shapes, sizes, and porosities are very important for breakthroughs in several technologies. The challenge for the so-called nanotechnologies is to achieve perfect control of nanoscale-related properties. This obviously requires correlating the parameters of the synthesis process with the resulting nanostructure. In the article, ‘‘Tuning the Properties of Nanocrystalline CdS Thin Films’’ by S.J. Ikhmayies, a review of the experimental methods for tuning the properties of nanocrystalline CdS thin films is performed. Nanocrystalline cadmium sulfide (CdS) thin films are of potential use in the technology of CdS/CdTe solar cells, photonics, detectors, and computing devices. Nanomaterials can be used to improve or change the properties of some products, alloys, and composites. In the work, ‘‘Effects of Al2O3 Nanopowders on the Wear Behavior of NiTi Shape Memory Alloys’’ by Y. Sahin and K.E. Oksuz, the authors prepared TiNi shape memory alloy and its composShadia J.

       "  'abstract': 'The prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases and their associated factors has been investigated in HIV populations from the Island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. The feces of 310 participants from the island of Bioko (260 HIV-positive and 50 HIV-negative) were analyzed by microscopic observation. Immunochromatography was also used to diagnose Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium spp. In addition, patients were asked for sociodemographic, economic and academic status, and CD4+ T cell counts were recorded. For HIV-positive patients, the prevalence of infection by intestinal parasites was 81.5% (212/260), 83.8% (218/260) by pathogenic helminths and 55.4% (168/260) by pathogenic protozoa (E. histolytica/dispar and Giardia duodenalis). Gender association was found between the infection by Ascaris and Schistosoma, a higher proportion being found in women; and between Entamoeba and the place of residence, a higher proportion being observed in the urban belt. Strongyloides stercoralis and Chilomastix mesnili appeared only in the people of this group, all the cases of Chilomastix being in females. For HIV-negative participants, the prevalence of infection by intestinal parasites was 74.0% (37/50), 90.0% (45/50) by pathogenic helminths and 66.0% (43/50) by pathogenic protozoa. Gender, educational level and low hygiene were associated with intestinal parasitic infection. When comparing the two groups (HIV-positive and HIV-negative), statistical association between HIV co-infection and infection by Giardia and Entamoeba was found. Diarrhea was also associated with intestinal parasitic infection in the HIV-positive group. Not only do our findings reflect high rates of intestinal parasitic infections in HIV-positive people, but also in the HIV-negative group, suggesting a closer relationship between sanitary status and living conditions than with immune status, and thus they highlight the need to carry out health education policies in the population. In addition, Schistosoma intercalatum/guineensis has been detected for the first time as an autochthonous parasite on the island.',\n",

When present at physiologic concentration, this small molecule binds to the glmS ribozyme and uncovers a latent self-cleavage activity that ultimately leads to degradation of the mRNA.

GlcN6P binding to this pre-organized RNA does not induce conformational changes; rather, the small molecule functions as a coenzyme, providing a catalytically essential amine group to the active site. The ribozyme is not a passive player, however. Active site functional groups are essential for catalysis, even in the presence of GlcN6P. In addition to being a superb experimental system with which to analyze how RNA catalysts can exploit small molecule coenzymes to broaden their chemical versatility, the presence of the glmS ribozyme in numerous pathogenic bacteria make this RNA an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics and antibacterial strategies.',\n",

A retrospective comparative consecutive case series of 22 eyes of 11 patients (5 males) uneventfully implanted with a Crystalens. Eyes with signs of posterior capsular opacification were excluded. All eyes were examined with 40 MHz UBM (Ellex Eyecubed) and spectral-domain OCT (Zeiss Visante). The angle aperture along the horizontal and vertical meridians was recorded based on the software of the systems. The coma root mean square (RMS) scores for the horizontal and vertical meridians were also recorded with the iTrace aberrometer. The anterior chamber angle was significantly wider along the horizontal axis compared with the vertical axis by UBM (46.37° and 44.20°, respectively) and by OCT (46.79° and 43.58°, respectively) (p = 0.02 in both cases, paired-samples t test). The correlations between the logMAR-converted Jaeger near vision score and the horizontal or vertical angle apertures was not statistically significant. Horizontal coma RMS was significantly inversely correlated with the horizontal angle aperture (r = -0.45, p = 0.03 and r = -0.39, p = 0.04 by OCT and UBM, respectively). Measurement of the horizontal angle aperture by the modalities used may represent an anatomical and clinical predictor of the optical aberrations induced by the Crystalens.',\n",

According to the recently revised classification criteria for APS, several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) should be performed simultaneously in routine laboratories for the detection of aPL antibodies. Therefore, new approaches to aPL profiling have been proposed recently to provide information regarding diagnosis and eventually outcome in APS patients. Multiplex analysis could meet the increasing demand for cost-efficient detection and profiling of aPL antibodies. Multi-line immunodot assays or bead-based multiplex techniques candidate as alternatives to assess several aPL antibodies simultaneously employing different solid-phases for bound/free separation of reactants. Particularly, multi-line immunodot assays present an alternative to ELISA for aPL antibody detection and profiling in APS patients. The use of hydrophobic membranes as solid-surface by this technique appears to offer a distinct solid-phase reaction environment for the assessment of aPL antibodies. This article reviews novel developments in the field of laboratory diagnostics of APS with special emphasis on multiplex assays.',\n",

The present study aimed at identifying the process of internalization that occurs during the increased trafficking of vesicles caused by Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV)-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Herein, we found that caveolin-1α is up-regulated in the cerebellar capillaries and Purkinje neurons of PNV-administered P14 (neonate) and 8- to 10-week-old (adult) rats. The white matter and granular layers were regions where caveolin-1α showed major upregulation. The variable age played a role in this effect. Caveolin-1 is the central protein that controls caveolae formation. Caveolar-specialized cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane sub-domains are involved in endocytosis, transcytosis, mechano-sensing, synapse formation and stabilization, signal transduction, intercellular communication, apoptosis, and various signaling events, including those related to calcium handling. PNV is extremely rich in neurotoxic peptides that affect glutamate handling and interferes with ion channels physiology. We suggest that the PNV-induced BBB opening is associated with a high expression of caveolae frame-forming caveolin-1α, and therefore in the process of internalization and enhanced transcytosis. Caveolin-1α up-regulation in Purkinje neurons could be related to a way of neurons to preserve, restore, and enhance function following PNV-induced excitotoxicity. The findings disclose interesting perspectives for further molecular studies of the interaction between PNV and caveolar specialized membrane domains. It proves PNV to be excellent tool for studies of transcytosis, the most common form of BBB-enhanced permeability.',\n",

A key step in the development of interfaces is therefore to identify implant configurations that minimize adverse long-term tissue reactions. To this end, we here characterized the separate and combined effects of implant size and fixation mode at 6 and 12 weeks post implantation in rat (n = 24) cerebral cortex. Neurons and activated microglia and astrocytes were visualized using NeuN, ED1 and GFAP immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. The contributions of individual experimental variables to the tissue response were quantified. Implants tethered to the skull caused larger tissue reactions than un-tethered implants. Small diameter (50 µm) implants elicited smaller tissue reactions and resulted in the survival of larger numbers of neurons than did large diameter (200 µm) implants. In addition, tethering resulted in an oval-shaped cavity, with a cross-section area larger than that of the implant itself, and in marked changes in morphology and organization of neurons in the region closest to the tissue interface. Most importantly, for implants that were both large diameter and tethered, glia activation was still ongoing 12 weeks after implantation, as indicated by an increase in GFAP staining between week 6 and 12, while this pattern was not observed for un-tethered, small diameter implants. Our findings therefore clearly indicate that the combined small diameter, un-tethered implants cause the smallest tissue reactions.',\n",

The first prototype of the detector consisting of four series elements is demonstrated with the ability to resolve up to four photons in an incident optical pulse at the telecommunicat ion wavelength window. Keywords: photon-number resolving detectors, superconducting single-photon detectors, quantum optics. 1. INTRODUCTION Standard linear optical detectors that generate an electrical response proportional to the intensity of the incident light have their maximum sensitivity in the few hundreds of photons range, limited by the amplifier noise. On the other hand, single photon detectors (SPDs), which are the most sensitive detectors, are strongly nonlinear: One or more photons result in the same output signal. The gap in between these two detection modes can be filled with photon number resolving (PNR) detectors, which have the sensitivity of SPDs and are able to determine the number of photons in a weak optical pulse. Such detectors are greatly desirable not only in the field of quantum information processing and quantum communication, but also in any application dealing with low light levels, such as fluorescence spectroscopy or optical time-domain reflect ometry. The existing appr oaches for realization of PNR detectors, especially in the telecom wavelength range do not meet all the essential requirements of most applications in terms of timing resolution, sensitivity, speed and dynamic range. In this work, we present a new PNR detector based on spatial multiplexing of nanowire superconducting single-photon detectors',\n",

All heats developed internal fractures under mean stress conditions of R≥0 with negligible frequency effects. The origins of the internal fractures proved not to be inclusions, but clusters of facets. Cross-sectional observations of the internal fractured specimen revealed the facets to have formed in the α-phase in an inclined direction. The gigacycle fatigue strength of the Ti–6Al–4V alloy at R=−1 matched that of quenched and tempered steel, while that under R=0 was clearly lower. Ti–6Al–4V alloy is more prone to internal fracturing under tensile mean stress conditions, resulting in reduced fatigue strength. Its gigacycle fatigue strengths are thus below the modified Goodman line at around R=0. This trend is very dangerous, since the modified Goodman line generally gives predictions with a good margin of safety.',\n",

Only a few molecular targets of the IgE response in S. mansoni infection have been characterised. A better insight into the basic mechanisms of anti-parasite immunity could be gained from a genome-wide characterisation of such S. mansoni allergens. This would have repercussions on our understanding of allergy and the development of safe and efficacious vaccinations against helminthic parasites. Methodology/Principal Findings: A complete medium- to high-throughput amenable workflow, including important quality controls, is described, which enables the rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins using wheat germ lysate and subsequent assessment of potential allergenicity with a humanised Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) reporter cell line. Cell-free translation is completed within 90 minutes, generating sufficient amounts of parasitic protein for rapid screening of allergenicity without any need for purification. Antigenic integrity is demonstrated using Western Blotting. After overnight incubation with infected individuals’ serum, the RS-ATL8 reporter cell line is challenged with the complete wheat germ translation mixture and Luciferase activity measured, reporting cellular activation by the suspected allergen. The suitability of this system for characterization of novel S. mansoni allergens is demonstrated using well characterised plant and parasitic allergens such as Par j 2, SmTAL-1 and the IgE binding factor IPSE/alpha-1, expressed in wheat germ lysates and/or E. coli. SmTAL-1, but not SmTAL2 (used as a negative control), was able to activate the basophil reporter cell line. Conclusion/Significance: This method offers an accessible way for assessment of potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates and is suitable for medium- to high-throughput studies using infected individual sera. It is also suitable for the study of the basis of allergenicity of helminthic proteins.',\n",

We showed that the average detection thresholds for RF trajectories range from 1 to 4 min of arc and performance improves as a power-law function of radial frequency. RF trajectories are also detected for a range of speeds. We also showed that spatiotemporal global processing is involved in trajectory detection, as improvement in detection performance with increasing radial deformation displayed cannot be accounted for by local probability summation. Finally, identification of RF trajectories is possible over this RF range. Overall thresholds are about 6 times higher than previously reported for static stimuli.

Others argue for an approach that weighs a species’ impact and role in a system before determining its desirability, irrespective of its identity. We suggest a middle-ground approach, one that does add extra caution about the desirability of non-native species relative to native species, but also bases perception and management decisions on the population stage of the non-native species and in relation to a wider range of conservation goals. In initial stages of introduction and establishment, we argue that a cautious approach is most prudent, one assuming the potential dangers of the new species in systems. In later stages of established populations, we argue that impact assessments will provide the soundest and more efficient management information, with origin and other available data included as part of the subsequent decision-making process.

Among the various approximation methods, robust optimization can provide safe and tractable analytical approximation. In this paper, we address the question of what is the optimal (least conservative) robust optimization approximation for the chance constrained optimization problems. A novel algorithm is proposed to find the smallest possible uncertainty set size that leads to the optimal robust optimization approximation. The proposed method first identifies the maximum set size that leads to feasible robust optimization problems and then identifies the best set size that leads to the desired probability of constraint satisfaction. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a portfolio optimization problem, a production planning and a process scheduling problem.',\n",

Standardized assessments of motor speed/ dexterity, verbal memory, visual perception, vocabulary, and visuospatial working memory were conducted in 19 pediatric patients receiving cranial RT and 55 controls at baseline and 6, 15, and 27 months following completion of RT. Prescription doses ranged from 12 Gy to 59.4 Gy. Linear mixed effects regression model analyses were used to examine the relationships among neuropsychological performance, age, and radiation dose to the subventricular zone, hippocampus, temporal lobes, and cerebrum. Results. Performance on all neuropsychological tests, except vocabulary, was significantly reduced in patients relative to controls, particularly among younger',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract. This paper presents an approach to enhance the role of local stakeholders in dealing with urban floods. The concept is based on the DIANE-CM project (Decentralised Integrated Analysis and Enhancement of Awareness through Collaborative Modelling and Management of Flood Risk) of the 2nd ERANET CRUE funding initiative. The main objective of the project was to develop and test an advanced methodology for enhancing the resilience of local communities to flooding. Through collaborative modelling, a social learning process was initiated that enhances the social capacity of the stakeholders due to the interaction process. The other aim of the project was to better understand how data from hazard and vulnerability analyses and improved maps, as well as from the near real-time flood prediction, can be used to initiate a public dialogue (i.e. collaborative mapping and planning activities) in order to carry out more informed and shared decision-making processes and to enhance flood risk awareness. The concept of collaborative modelling was applied in two case studies: (1) the Cranbrook catchment in the UK, with focus on pluvial flooding; and (2) the Alster catchment in Germany, with focus on fluvial flooding. As a result of the interactive and social learning process, supported by sociotechnical instruments, an understanding of flood risk was developed amongst the stakeholders and alternatives for flood risk management for the respective case study area were jointly developed and ranked as a basis for further planning and management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Dental health may deteriorate in populations exposed to economic growth as a result of easier access to refined carbohydrates and sugars. Such changes affected migrant labourers working in Kimberley, South Africa, during the late 19th century. A rescue excavation salvaged several skeletons from pauper's graves dating from this period, and the purpose of the study was to assess their dental health to determine whether it concurs with historical statements suggesting that the skeletal population sample being investigated was migrant labourers with limited access to a healthy diet. According to historic sources their diets mainly consisted of ground carbohydrates and occasional meat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe permanent dentition of 79 males and 13 females (majority between 20 and 49 years of age) were examined. Carious lesions were observed in 57% of males and 46.2% of females with an average of 2.7 and 3.8 carious teeth per mouth. The anterior teeth were significantly less affected than the posterior teeth. Periodontal granulomata (‘abscesses’) were observed in 17.7% of males and 15.4% of females, and periodontal disease affected 40% of those investigated. Antemortem tooth loss (AMTL) was recorded in 29% (N\\u2009=\\u200927) of the sample with an average of 3.5 teeth lost per mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was concluded that the prevalence of dental caries, periapical granulomata and periodontal disease as well as the pattern of AMTL observed concurs with dietary descriptions for paupers in historical documents. The relatively low prevalence of carious lesions can be ascribed to the limited time migrant labourers spent in Kimberley and the labour restrictions they had to comply with during their stay in the compounds.

Besides the established response of total cortisol (TC) concentrations during inflammatory processes in dairy cows, we investigated changes of corticosterone, free cortisol (FC), and serum albumin as the main protein of unspecific cortisol binding, in response to an intramammary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Furthermore, we evaluated relationships of glucocorticoid responses with concomitant alterations of metabolites and their endocrine regulators, insulin and glucagon. Blood samples of 10 multiparous Holstein dairy cows (26.8 ± 3.4\\xa0d in milk, previous lactation yield: 7,601 ± 938\\xa0kg; mean ± SD) were obtained every 30\\xa0min up to 5\\xa0h after the LPS instillation, and rectal temperature and heart rate were measured in parallel. Corticosterone was measured by enzyme immunoassay, TC by radioimmunoassay, and the proportion of FC by ultrafiltration. A mixed model was used to evaluate differences within the investigated parameters among selected time points (0, 3.5, and 5\\xa0h relative to the intramammary LPS administration). Rectal temperature increased up to 41.6 ± 0.1°C at 5\\xa0h after the LPS application. Concentrations of TC and corticosterone increased until 3.5\\xa0h, and the proportion of FC relative to TC more than doubled until 3.5\\xa0h after LPS administration.

In conclusion, the stimulation of the immune system by the intramammary LPS administration is accompanied by distinct metabolic and endocrine changes. Corticosterone and TC concentrations react similarly in response to the LPS challenge and earlier compared with metabolic adaptations.

       "  'abstract': 'Change detection based on satellite images acquired from an area at different dates is of widespread interest, according to the increasing number of flood-related disasters. The images help to generate products that support emergency response and flood management at a global scale. In this paper, a novel unsupervised change detection approach based on image fusion is introduced. The approach aims to extract the reliable flood extent from very high-resolution (VHR) bi-temporal images. The method takes an advantage of the spectral distortion that occurs during image fusion process to detect the change areas by flood. To this end, a change candidate image is extracted from the fused image generated with bi-temporal images by considering a local spectral distortion. This can be done by employing a universal image quality index (UIQI), which is a measure for local evaluation of spectral distortion. The decision threshold for the determination of changed pixels is set by applying a probability mixture model to the change candidate image based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We used bi-temporal KOMPSAT-2 satellite images to detect the flooded area in the city of N′djamena in Chad. The performance of the proposed method was visually and quantitatively compared with existing change detection methods. The results showed that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy (OA = 75.04) close to that of the support vector machine (SVM)-based supervised change detection method. Moreover, the proposed method showed a better performance in differentiating the flooded area and the permanent water body compared to the existing change detection methods.',\n",

A design solution for both Upper and Lower Steering M4 Mirrors capable to withstand the loads taking place during normal operation was already proposed. This design is now assessed against the Vertical Displacement Event Category III (VDEIII) linear decay (36\\u2009ms) scenario, which was identified as one of the most stringent load combinations for the steering M4 mirrors.   This paper reports the analyses performed to quantify the mechanical loads induced in the steering M4 mirrors during the VDEIII scenario as well as the structural integrity assessment to validate the design against these loads. The transient electromagnetic simulations show that the highest forces are induced in the reflecting surfaces, which produce a bending moment that tends to rotate upwards the mirrors. The comparison between the categorized stresses obtained from the transient mechanical analyses and the allowable design limits according to the ASME code shows that the design of the steering M4 mirrors is widely capable of withstanding the expected loads taking place during the VDEIII scenario.',\n",

The short- and long-term variabilities in TEC have been assessed by using spectral, regression and statistical analysis. To ascertain the quiet-time climatology, TEC data have been used after filtering out the solar flares and geomagnetic storms effects. The present analysis exhibits a double-hump structure and clockwise hysteresis in TEC as regards Solar Cycle\\xa024. The solar flux and TEC trend are found to be irregularly and slow during the rise and smooth and quick during the fall period of Solar Cycle\\xa024. Seasonally, the semiannual anomaly is found to be a consistent feature for all phases of the solar cycle, while the winter anomaly seems to be facilitated with a level of solar activity during solstices. Another purpose of the present work is to investigate the performance of IRI-2016 and the TIE-GCM 2.0 models in comparison with GPS-TEC during Solar Cycle\\xa024. Almost perfect agreement is found between observed and modeled TEC, delineating similar trends of the solar cycle, and of semiannual and seasonal variations. Nevertheless, significant biases are apparent between the observed and modeled TEC in terms of local time, seasons and phases of solar activity. Our results show the error in the model estimations in noontime TEC, which is as high as 100% in the IRI model and as low as 60% in the TIE-GCM model. Thus, in general, the IRI model overestimates the noon time TEC values, while TIE-GCM underestimates them.',\n",

Due to selective breeding, fewer breeding individuals are used in culture relative to wild populations, potentially leading to inbreeding within single cages.

       "  'abstract': 'Catatonia was described for the first time by Kahlbaum in 1874 (1). It can be defined schematically as a motor dysregulation syndrome accompanied with a behavioral component. There are three main forms of catatonia: (i) akinetic, (ii) hyperkinetic, and (iii) malignant catatonia (2). These various phenotypes of the same syndrome led to a clinical heterogeneousness making the catatonia difficult to recognize and diagnose. It seems, however, that certain clinical signs occur with a greater frequency in catatonia. Indeed, in a study involving more than 230 catatonic patients, the “staring,” was found in more than 80% of cases. Among other frequent signs, were the immobility in 70% of cases, the mutism in 60% of patients, and the withdrawal in 50% of them (3). Various specific scales were developed to allow a more accurate diagnostic approach to catatonia. The Bush-Francis catatonia rating scale is the most commonly used one. It has many advantages: in addition to having a sensitivity of reaching 100% and a specificity between 75 and 100%, it is fast and easy to use in daily clinical practice (4). It is important to note that catatonia is a transnosographic syndrome with various underlying psychiatric and somatic causes. Most common somatic causes include epilepsy, systemic lupus erythematosus, intermittent porphyria, traumatic brain injury, dementia, encephalopathies (autoimmune, paraneoplastic, Hashimoto, etc.) (5). Furthermore, catatonia is found among 10% of psychiatric inpatients (6). Under the influence of Kraeplin, catatonia was linked for a long time exclusively with schizophrenia (7). However, recent epidemiological studies showed that schizophrenia is found only in 20% of catatonic cases while mood disorders underlie 45% of cases (8). Catatonia is also frequent in children and adolescents, particularly in autism spectrum disorders where the prevalence varies between 12 and 17% (9). Despite these clinical and epidemiological facts, few data exist concerning the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this syndrome. In this paper, we will make the synthesis of the existing data concerning the neurocognitive and neurobiological mechanisms involved in the akinetic forms of catatonia.',\n",

It was found that As(III) was oxidized to As(V) in the presence of HQ or BQ at neutral conditions, and the oxidation efficiency of As(III) increased from 33% to 92% in HQ solutions and from 0 to 80% in BQ solutions with pH increasing from 6.5 to 8.5. The oxidation mechanism was further explored with electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. The results showed that semiquinone radicals (SQ   − ) were generated from the comproportionation reaction between BQ and HQ, which mediated the formation of superoxide anion (O 2     − ), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroxyl radical ( OH). Both the SQ   − , H 2 O 2   and   OH contributed to the oxidation of As(III).

       "  'abstract': \"Nowadays, learning is more and more taking place anywhere and anytime. This implies that e-learning environments are expanded from only virtual learning environments to both virtual and physical ones. Thanks to the evolution of Internet, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and Internet of Things, new learning scenarios could be experienced by learners either individually or collaboratively. These learning scenarios are Pervasive in such a way that they allow to mix virtual and physical learning environments as well. They are therefore characterized by possible interactions of the learner with the physical environment, the Learner's contextual data detection as well as the adaptation of pedagogical strategies and services according to this context. This paper aims to take advantage of this trend and keep up also with existing e-Learning standards such as IMS LD and LOM. The solution proposed is therefore to extend these standards models with that of Internet of Things and to provide an adaptation approach of learning activities based on learner's context and her/his track using the eXperience API. In this context and in order to allow both reasoning capabilities and interoperability between the proposed models Ontological representations and implementation are therefore proposed. Moreover a technical architecture highlighting the required software components and their interactions is provided. And finally, a relevant pervasive learning scenario is implemented and experimented.\",\n",

Materials and methods   We reviewed 41 cases of GCT of the bone that was treated by En bloc resection around the knee joint and in the distal radius from 2011 to 2018. The local recurrence, metastases, complications and functional score were evaluated for each operation technique.       Results   The average of MSTS score for all group was 78% (excellent). In the knee joint, the megaprostheses group had an excellent MSTS score of78.9% and good 21.1%. The MAMC group had an excellent MSTS score of40.0%, good 50.0% and fair 10.0%. One patient in the megaprostheses group had metastasis to the lung and 1 patient in the knee arthrodesis group has a recurrence. Infection occurred in 2 cases of megaprostheses while only 1 case in MAMC. Both of the groups in knee joint GCT had 1 patient with implant loosening. In the distal radius, FVFG group had an excellent MSTS score 100% and NVFG group had an excellent score 77.7%, good 11.1% and fair 11.1%. One patient in the NVFG group had an infection, 1 patient has implant loosening and another one patient had graft failure. Two patients in the NVFG group had a recurrence. No metastasis was found in both of the group types of surgery in distal radius GCT.       Conclusion   Functional outcome of a patient with GCT of the bone after En bloc resection and reconstruction with the above techniques had comparable results with previous studies.',\n",

Studying the basic phenomenon in microfluidics has also generated new knowledge, which could be pivotal in the design of novel devices. Many studies, however, have focused on designs featuring nanoslits/slots or surface-patterned ion-selective membranes whereas the characteristics of 1D nanochannels are still lacking. Here, we report on ion concentration polarization across highly ordered 1D nanochannels in isolation as well as in array formation. Intriguingly, the nanochannels in isolation exhibit a linear current-voltage characteristic at low salt concentrations despite the confirmed presence of ion-depletion zone, which is associated with the diffusion-limited transport and the consequent nonlinearity in the classical sense. The characteristic in array formation breaks away from the linearity with a peculiar dip in current for a critical salt concentration in the dilute limit. We describe these findings based on the interplay between the nanochannel conductance and the conductance of the neighboring microchannel walls (the so-called surface shunt). Also, the nanochannel transport is identified with the mobility of protons more closely than that of salt cations. We attribute fast transport to phosphorus-doped silicate glass, the nanochannel material known to have very fine pores likely to be populated with protons as a result of moisture and carbon dioxide adsorption from the air. The nanochannels possess a tubular profile 70 nm in nominal diameter and fabricated through thermal reflow of doped glass on silicon without using advanced lithography.',\n",

We provide differential equations and discrete-time computable equations for the core oscillator model developed by Edward Large for simulating rhythm perception. Using a mechanical analog parameterization, we derive a force-feedback model structure that enables a human to share control of a virtual percussion instrument with a \"robotic\" neural oscillator. A formal human subject test indicated that strong coupling (STRNG) between the force-feedback device and the neural oscillator provided subjects with the best control. Overall, the human subjects predominantly found the interaction to be \"enjoyable\" and \"fun\" or \"entertaining.\" However, there were indications that some subjects preferred a medium-strength coupling (MED), presumably because they were unaccustomed to such strong force-feedback interaction with an external agent. With related models, test subjects performed better when they could synchronize their input in phase with a dominant sensory feedback modality. In contrast, subjects tended to perform worse when an optimal strategy was to move the force-feedback device with a 90° phase lag. Our results suggest an extension of dynamic pattern theory to force-feedback tasks. In closing, we provide an overview of how a similar force-feedback scenario could be used in a more complex musical robotics setting.',\n",

The challenge is to develop mathematical methods that allow the integration and extraction of knowledge from large datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This has led to the development of a variety of omics profiles that are highly correlated with each other; however, it remains unknown which profile is the most meaningful and how to efficiently integrate different omics profiles. We developed AMARETTO, an algorithm to identify cancer drivers by integrating a variety of omics data from cancer and normal tissue. AMARETTO first models the effects of genomic/epigenomic data on disease-specific gene expression. AMARETTO's second step involves constructing a module network to connect the cancer drivers with their downstream targets. We observed that more gene expression variation can be explained when using disease-specific gene expression data. We applied AMARETTO to the ovarian cancer TCGA data and identified several cancer driver genes of interest, including novel genes in addition to known drivers of cancer.

       "  'abstract': 'Background   End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is one of the leading non-communicable diseases worldwide which at the same time costs immense amount of both financial and human resources. The number of ESRD patients continues to grow, and the need to provide different modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT) increases.   Materials and methods   We conducted a retrospective study on the incidence and prevalence of RRT in the Middle East (ME) and the treatment modality, and correlated the findings with the economic status.   Results   The predominant age group of patients receiving RRT in ME countries is 0 - 39, compared with the age group of 25 - 59 in Western countries. The reported prevalence of RRT is directly proportional to the economic status of the country, with low-income countries having low prevalence of RRT and high-income countries having higher prevalence. Diabetes mellitus (DM) as the leading cause of ESRD has a high prevalence in the ME according to the World Health Organization (WHO); the projected prevalence by the year 2035 is 85%. RRT in ME shows 75.81% of patients are on hemodialysis (HD), 3.25% on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 20.93% were post-transplant recipients. Internationally, 77%, 16%, and 6% were on HD, PD, and post-transplant, respectively, in Europe; 63.1%, 6.9%, and 29.6% in the USA; and 12%, 70%, and 18% in Mexico. HD was the predominant modality of RRT in ME, while PD is underutilized, and transplantation was mostly from living donors; deceased-donor transplantation is not available in many countries. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is the main provider of RRT in ME; next, charitable organizations provide a significant proportion of RRT; and lastly, through private sectors for patients who could afford the cost of the therapy. In our survey, kidney transplantation in ME was mainly from living donors with almost 77.7% of the total kidneys transplanted while deceased donors comprised 22.3%. The overall graft survival was 93.7% and 84.23% after 1 and 5 years, respectively. Internationally, there are 17 accessible renal registries, compared with only 1 in the ME, resident in Saudi Arabia. Of the patients receiving RRT, 80% are on HD; chronic kidney disease (CKD) is found in ~ 10% of the population in the region.   Conclusion   There is a high CKD burden in the ME countries. There needs to be emphasis on prevention of ESRD and provision of adequate care for the total ESRD patient population. National renal registries are needed to monitor the status of ESRD patients. Health expenditures should be increased to cover all aspects of RRT in ME Countries.',\n",

A group of Monascus orange pigment (MOP) amino acid derivatives, in which the reactive oxygen moiety was changed to amino acids, significantly inhibited HCV replication. Further, combination of the MOP derivatives (Phe, Val or Leu conjugates) with interferon (IFN)-a inhibited HCV replication more than IFN-a treatment alone. Lastly, molecular docking studies indicate the inhibitors may bind to a thumb subdomain allosteric site of NS5B. The antiviral activity of the MOP derivatives was related to a modulation of the mevalonate pathway, since the mevalonate-induced increase in HCV replication was suppressed by the MOP compounds. Conclusions: Our results identify amino acid derivatives of MOP as potential anti-HCV agents and suggest that their combination with IFN-a might offer an alternative strategy for the control of HCV replication.',\n",

The changes in germination and vigour of kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea L. var. gongylodes L.) seeds subjected to two priming methods in the presence of A. brassicicola were investigated. The following treatments were applied: uninoculated non-primed seeds (control), seeds inoculated with A. brassicicola (2·10 4 spores ml -1 ), uninoculated and inoculated seeds hydroprimed for 1-2 days, and uninoculated and inoculated seeds osmoprimed for 1-4 days. The percent- age of germinating seeds, germination capacity, the percentages of diseased seedlings and dead seeds were determined. The speed of germination, tetrazolium staining index, and electrical conductivity described seed vigour. The presence of A. brassicicola on/in seeds was confirmed on CW semiselective agar. Osmopriming was conducive to penetration of A. brassicicola into kohlrabi seeds. The presence of the fungus had no influence on the percentage of germinating seeds, but a significantly lower germination capacity and a higher percentage of diseased seedlings and dead seeds were observed after inoculation. Non-primed inoculated seeds germinated faster than uninoculated ones. Despite the pres- ence of A. brassicicola, osmotic priming improved seed vigour as measured by the speed of seed germination and electrical conductivity. The results of the tetrazolium vigour test showed its limited usefulness for seeds heavily infected with A. brassicicola.',\n",

To address this concern, we generated an experimental electron density map from single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of an original mouse Pgp dataset to 3.8 Aresolution. The map exhibited significantly more detail compared to the original MAD map and revealed several regions of the structure that required de novo model building. The improved drug-free structure was refined to 3.8 Aresolution with a 9.4 and 8.1% decrease in Rwork and Rfree, respectively, (Rwork 521.2%, Rfree 526.6%) and a significant improvement in protein geometry. The improved mouse Pgp model contains ~95% of residues in the favorable Ramachandran region compared to only 57% for the original model. The registry of six transmembrane helices was cor- rected, revealing amino acid residues involved in drug binding that were previously unrecognized. Registry shifts (rotations and translations) for three transmembrane (TM)4 and TM5 and the addi- tion of three N-terminal residues were necessary, and were validated with new mercury labeling and anomalous Fourier density. The corrected position of TM4, which forms the frame of a portal for drug entry, had backbone atoms shifted > 6Afrom their original positions. The drug transloca- tion pathway of mouse Pgp is 96% identical to human Pgp and is enriched in aromatic residues that likely play a collective role in allowing a high degree of polyspecific substrate recognition.',\n",

For this study we developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model of population growth to represent the complex population dynamics of invasive marine macroalgae with heteromorphic biphasic life cycles. The model framework represents this complex life cycle by treating the individual developmental stages (gametophytes/sporophytes) as autonomous agents with unique behaviour/growth parameters. It was parameterised to represent a well-documented invasive algal species, the Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida, and validated against field results from an in situ population in Brittany, France, showing good quantitative agreement in terms of seasonal changes in abundance/recruitment and growth dynamics. It was then used to explore how local environmental parameters (light availability, temperature and day length) affect the population dynamics of the individual developmental stages and the overall population growth. This type of modelling approach represents a promising tool for understanding the population dynamics of macroalgae from the bottom-up in terms of the individual interactions between the independent life history stages (both microscopic and macroscopic). It can be used to trace back the behaviour of the population as a whole to the underlying physiological and environmental processes impacting each developmental stage and give insights into the roles these play in invasion success.',\n",

This study was established to investigate the associations between polymorphisms in cytokine-encoding genes, autoantibodies and therapeutic responses in Japanese RA patients.   Methods   The subjects in this study consisted of 100 RA patients and 50 healthy controls. We extracted data on sex, age, disease duration, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, and therapeutic responses, including to methotrexate (MTX) and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, which was genotyped for IL-10, TNF-α, TGF-β1, and IFN-γ polymorphisms.   Results   Regarding IL-10 (-592 C/A and -819 C/T), significant decreases in the frequencies of the IL-10 (-592) CC genotype and (-819) CC genotype were found in RA patients compared with the levels in controls. For IFN-γ (+874 T/A), a significant decrease in the frequency of the TT genotype was found in RA patients compared with that in controls. Regarding TGF-β1 (+869 T/C), patients with positivity for anti-CCP antibody had a significantly lower frequency of the CC genotype than those with negativity for it. Furthermore, the IL-10 (-592) CC genotype and (-819) CC genotype might be related to the biological DMARD-response.

The specificity and detection limits of six tetracyclines in milk were determined.

       "  'abstract': 'Objective Vascular dementia (VaD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with cognitive decline caused by cerebrovascular factors. Despite the great progress made in the past decade, VaD still lacks effective treatments and peripheral blood biomarkers. In this study, we tested the level of peripheral blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) in VaD patients and explored its relationship with cognitive impairment. Method A total of 176 study subjects including 80 normal controls (NC) and 96 VaD patients were included in our study. Upon admission, we collected clinical and biochemical characteristics of all research subjects. We also evaluate the Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA) scores of all subjects. The serum NfL level was measured by the single-molecule array (Simoa) method. Results The years of education in the NC group and VaD group were (11.65 ± 3.04) years and (10.53 ± 3.87) years, respectively. Compared with VaD patients, the NC group has a higher level of education (p = 0.037). Furthermore, the results of Simoa indicated that VaD subjects had higher serum NfL levels compared with the NC group [(8.49 ± 2.37) pg/ml vs. (19.26 ± 4.71) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. In terms of other clinical and biochemical characteristics, there was no significant difference between VaD and NC. The Spearman correlation analysis indicated that educational years have a significant positive correlation with MoCA scores (r = 0.238, p = 0.041), while age and serum NfL levels have a significantly negative correlation with MoCA scores (age: r = -0.213, p = 0.040; NfL: r = -0.395, p = 0.027). However, further multiple regression analysis showed that only serum NfL level might serve as an independent risk factor for cognitive decline in VaD (β = 0.317, p = 0.021). Conclusion The serum NfL levels in VaD subjects are significantly elevated, which may be used as a potential peripheral blood marker for predicting cognitive impairment in patients with VaD.',\n",

Methods   Patients who were diagnosed with Immunoglobulin A vasculitis were included in the study. Urine samples were collected for determination of urine KIM-1and NGAL levels. The control group was comprised of age-matched healthy children.   Results   61 patients who diagnosed with Immunoglobulin A vasculitis were included in the study. 37.7% of these patients were determined to have renal involvement. Median KIM-1 was found to be statistically significantly higher in the patient group (69.59 pg/ml) compared to the control group (40.84 pg/ml) (p= 0.001). Median NGAL was determined to be statistically significantly higher in the patient group (59.87 ng/ml) compared to the control group (44.87 ng/ml) (p=0.013). In 23.6% of the patients without renal involvement at admission were found to develop renal involvement within following six months. When median KIM-1 and NGAL at admission of these patients were compared with the control group, they were determined to be statistically significantly higher (p= 0.001, p= 0.003).   Conclusions   The fact that our patients with late-term nephropathy had no hematuria and/or proteinuria and that KIM-1and NGAL levels, however, were determined to be high indicates that these biomarkers might be potentially reliable, noninvasive and early determinants of kidney injury.',\n",

Educational solutions were searched in publications related to: health education, andragogy, propaganda and direct marketing. The empirical material used to characterize two target groups came from four research (qualitative and quantitative) conducted by the National Centre for Workplace Health Promotion (Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine) in 2007-2010.   Results   Low educated employees' health education should be focused on increasing responsibility for health and strengthening their self-confidence according to the introduction of healthy lifestyle changes. To achieve these goals, important issue is to build their motivation to develop knowledge about taking care of health. In providing such information we should avoid the methods associated with school. Another important issue is creating an appropriate infrastructure and conditions facilitating the change of harmful behaviors undertaken at home and in the workplace. According to high-educated employees a challenge is to support taking health behaviors--although they are convinced it is important for their health, such behaviors are perceived as a difficult and freedom restriction. Promoting behavior change techniques, avoiding prohibitions in the educational messages and creating favorable climate for taking care of health in groups they participate are needed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Hemodialysis mainly removes small water-soluble uremic toxins but cannot effectively remove middle molecules and protein-bound uremic toxins. Besides, the therapy is intermittent leading to fluctuating blood values and fluid status which adversely impacts patients’ health. Prolonged hemodialysis (with adequate anticoagulation) could improve the removal of toxins and the development of portable and wearable artificial kidneys could offer more flexibility in the dialysis scheme. This would enhance patients’ overall health, autonomy, mobility and flexibility, allowing patients to participate in social and economic life. However, the time that patients’ blood is exposed to the dialyzer material is longer during prolonged hemodialysis, and blood clots could obstruct the fiber lumen, resulting in a decrease of the effective membrane surface area available for toxin removal. The outside-in filtration (OIF) mode, wherein blood flows through the inter-fiber space instead of through the fiber lumina, has been applied widely in blood oxygenators to prevent fiber clotting, but not in hemodialysis.   In this study, we present for the first time the development of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) for OIF of human blood plasma. This MMM combines diffusion and adsorption and consists of a polymeric membrane matrix with activated carbon (AC) particles on the inside layer, and a polymeric particle-free layer on the outer fiber layer. Our results show that in vitro MMM fibers for OIF demonstrate superior removal of the protein-bound uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid, compared to both earlier MMM fibers designed for inside-out filtration mode and commercial high-flux fibers.       Statement of significance   Current hemodialysis therapy cannot effectively remove protein-bound toxins. Prolonged hemodialysis could improve toxin removal. However, during prolonged hemodialysis, blood clots could obstruct the fiber lumen, resulting in decreased effective membrane surface area available for toxin removal.   We have prepared, for the first time, dual layer mixed matrix hollow fiber membranes (MMM) for outside-in filtration (OIF). The OIF mode wherein blood would flow through the inter-fiber space instead of through the fiber lumina could prevent fiber clotting. Moreover, the MMMs combine diffusion and adsorption to improve (protein-bound) toxin removal.   We believe that the new design of our MMM fibers is an important contribution concerning the development of artificial kidney systems and the improvement of the health and well-being of patients with renal failure.',\n",

Identifying words in the review towards which the user holds a sentiment, known as Aspect Target Extraction (ATE) or Opinion Target Extraction (OTE), is a crucial step in ABSA. Several start-of-the-art techniques, mostly employing Deep Learning methods, have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, when attempting ATE in a new domain, most of the supervised methods are crippled by a lack of labeled data within the domain and do not perform well with models built on other unrelated domains. Other unsupervised methods based on linguistic rules framed by experts have been proposed to mitigate the problem of the lack of data but this requires manual engineering of rules, which may not capture all aspect terms. Different from the previous approaches, we propose evolutionary methods to generate pattern graphs, which encode rules to identify cross-domain aspect terms. The proposed methods aim to mine linguistic patterns, which are quality indicators of the presence of aspect words. The automated pattern learning technique using the evolutionary approach enables automated learning of rules. This approach eliminates the need for human experts to coin the same, while at the same time enabling the production of complicated rules, which can identify cross-domain aspects effectively. Two slightly different approaches are proposed — the first based on identifying opinion targets by matching the learned pattern graphs against existing sentences and the second based on using the learned pattern graphs to construct features for building classification models for aspect identification. We conduct extensive experiments using 10 real-life datasets of varying sizes and different characteristics, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods for cross-domain ATE. We find that the proposed approaches perform better as compared to the existing methods in 69 of the 90 cases, or in other words, 76% of the cases.',\n",

Women, in particular, are the worst sufferers. Gender-related comprehensive studies regarding the prevalence and risks of undernutrition among the tribes have not been properly pursued in India; the vulnerability of the young females has least been examined.   Methods and findings   We conducted a cross-sectional study during January 2011 to December 2013 among 1066 males and 1090 females (n = 2156) in the 20-60 years age group belonging to the nine major tribes; Santals, Oraons and Koras (West Bengal): Santals, Bhumijs and Bathudis (Odisha): Dhodias, Kuknas and Chaudharis (Gujarat). The undernutrition burden was estimated and such risks were analyzed for the women in comparison to the men. The overall undernutrition among the females was found to be 47.4% (95% CI 44.4-50.4) against 32.1% (95% CI 29.3-34.9) among males, indicating about a half of the female population undernourished. The odds of risks for underweight status among females were observed to be high in comparison to males with an odds of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.6-2.2; p≤0.001) for the overall undernutrition category, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3-2.3; p≤0.001) for the mild undernutrition category, 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6; p≤0.01) for combined moderate and mild undernutrition category and 3.3 (95% CI at 2.3-4.6; p≤0.001) for severe undernutrition category. The young females were observed with a high prevalence of undernutrition along with increased risk. The 30-year mean BMI trend of the Indian population in comparison to the males, females, and overall tribal population places the tribal females at the highest risk.   Conclusion   Indian tribes are suffering from the higher prevalence of undernutrition by further highlighting a high gender bias. The health and empowerment of adolescent and young tribal girls needs additional focus. Overall, no remarkable control on undernutrition has been achieved among Indian tribes despite various efforts.',\n",

This defines an output feedback controller. The hybrid loop consists of a continuous-time dynamics when the estimate of the state leads to a nonincrease of a suitable Lyapunov-like function and in a jump equation when this condition is not satisfied. The jump equation is defined by means of a static state-feedback law from the observed state. Four techniques based on different reset maps and flow and jump sets are proposed, all of them exploiting a suitable dwell-time logic.

Results Both the operation time and duration of postoperative drainage were initially longer in the U-VATS group, but the difference gradually decreased such that ultimately there was no significant difference compared to the 3P-VATS group (P=0.10 and P=0.12, respectively). The duration of postoperative hospital stay and postoperative recurrence rate were not different between the two groups (P=0.084 and P=0.44, respectively). By multivariate analysis, the age (HR, 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.72, P<0.01) and number of bullae (single vs. multiple: HR, 0.03, 95% CI: 0.002-0.54, P=0.02) were risk factors for recurrence. Conclusions The perioperative results and recurrence rate did not differ between the U-VATS and 3P-VATS groups, thereby demonstrating the non-inferiority of U-VATS. Postoperative risk factors for PSP recurrence were patient age and the number of bullae. Additional treatment may be needed to reduce recurrence in young patients with multiple bullae.

Chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) form an important class of these pollutants. In this study, a new set of sorbents based on germania decorated mesoporous alumina-silica were utilized to extract and analyze twelve different CHCs that are usually found in wastewater bodies. The sorbents were characterized using XRD, FTIR, BET and FESEM.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract We investigate how predicates expressing symmetry, asymmetry and non-symmetry are encoded in a newly emerging sign language, Central Taurus Sign Language (CTSL). We find that predicates involving symmetry (i.e., reciprocal and symmetrical actions) differ from those involving asymmetry (i.e., transitive) in their use of the morphological devices investigated here: body segmentation, mirror-image articulators and double perspective. Symmetrical predicates also differ from non-symmetrical ones (i.e., intransitive) in their use of mirror-image configuration. Furthermore, reciprocal actions are temporally sequenced within a linear structure, whereas symmetrical actions are not. Thus, our data reveal that CTSL expresses each type of action with a particular combination of linguistic devices to encode symmetry, asymmetry, and non-symmetry. Furthermore, differences in the use of these devices across age cohorts of CTSL suggest that some have become more conventionalized over time. The same semantic distinctions have been observed – though with different realization – in another emerging sign language, Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL). This converging suggests that natural human language learning capacities include an expectation to distinguish symmetry, asymmetry and non-symmetry.',\n",

Evaluate the results of the standardization of the in vitro production program of buffalo embryos, using oocytes obtained by ultrasound guided oocyte puncture during the 2012 breeding season in Colombia. Materials and methods. Fifty seven buffalo females were selected for ultrasound guided transvaginal aspiration of follicles, oocytes were identified within follicular fluid, classified and transported to the laboratory and matured in vitro for 18 to 20 hours. Frozen semen of seven Mediterranean bulls were used, motile sperm was obtained using the Percoll technique and oocytes were inseminated with 2 million sperm/ml. Presumptive zygotes were cultured for 6 days, grade 1 embryos obtained were frozen using ethylene glycol. Embryos were transferred to females on day 5 during natural cycle. Results. 97 aspirations were performed on the 57 animals, in 8.2% of the aspirations no oocytes were found. 8 oocytes/aspiration were obtained. Of the 783 oocytes, 92% were classified as viable (721/783) and were fertilized. The cleavage and blastocyst rate were 23% and 19% respectively. 37 embryos were transferred and 11 pregnancies were obtained, confirmed by rectal palpation 60 days after transfer, with a pregnancy rate of 29.7%.

       "  'abstract': \"The rapid development and implementation of distributed control algorithms for dc microgrids has increased the vulnerability of this type of system to false data injection attacks, being one of the most prominent types of cyber attacks. This fact has motivated the development of different false data detection and impact mitigation strategies. A common approach for the detection is based on implementing an observer that can achieve a reliable estimation of the system states. However, approaches available in the literature assume that the underlying microgrid model is linear, which is generally not the case, specially when the dc microgrid supplies nonlinear constant power loads (CPLs). Consequently, this article proposes a distributed nonlinear observer approach that can robustly detect and reconstruct the applied false data attack in the dc microgrid's current sensors and cyber links, even in the presence of local unknown CPLs. First, the system is transformed into an observable form. Second, a high-order sliding-mode observer is implemented to estimate the system states and CPL, even in the presence of false data. Finally, the estimation is used to reconstruct the attack signal. The robustness of the proposed strategy is validated through numerical simulations and in an experimental prototype under measurement noise, uncertainty, and communication delays.\",\n",

However, data examining fetal sex-specific differences in maternal immune parameters is lacking. In the current study, serum levels of interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α as well as LPS-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β by PBMCs incubated for 24h were assessed in early, mid, and late pregnancy among 80 women (46 with male and 34 with female fetuses). Linear mixed models showed that women carrying females versus males exhibited greater stimulated production of IL-6 at each timepoint (ps⩽0.03), TNF-α in early pregnancy (p=0.04), and IL-1β in mid- and late pregnancy (ps⩽0.05). Despite changes in serum levels of IL-8 (p=0.002) and TNF-α (p 0.85). In conclusion, in pregnant women, those carrying female versus male fetuses exhibited greater stimulated cytokine production across pregnancy. Differential inflammatory responses could affect maternal health and fetal development. Fetal sex should be considered as a factor in studies of maternal inflammation. These findings have relevance both clinically and conceptually. For example, maternal asthma is exacerbated among women carrying female versus male fetuses. In addition, data on associations between fetal sex and maternal immune function among women with health conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) would be informative.',\n",

       "  'abstract': '[1] In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to assess gravity wave forcing of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in January-February 2006 and 2007. The model domain is configured as a tropical channel with a horizontal grid-spacing of 37 km and a top at 0.1 hPa. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis Interim data provide initial and boundary conditions. In these simulations a large part of the gravity wave spectrum is explicitly simulated. The model is shown to have a realistic representation of tropical precipitation variability, mean tropical ascent, and evolution of the stratospheric zonal mean wind. The high-resolution model outputs are used to compute gravity wave forcing of the QBO. It is shown that gravity waves account for � 60% of the total eastward forcing during the westerly shear phase and for � 80% of the total westward forcing during the easterly shear phase. These estimates are in agreement with previous evaluations of gravity wave forcing of the QBO. In addition, wave forcing associated with large-horizontal-scale inertia-gravity waves is computed. In the simulations, sufficient vertical resolution in the stratosphere is required to properly resolve large-horizontal-scale inertia-gravity waves near the peak in QBO forcing. In the WRF experiments this wave type represents � 30% of the total gravity wave forcing. This suggests that large-horizontal-scale inertia-gravity waves can play an important role in the forcing of the QBO.',\n",

The concentration of sodium silicate in the electrolyte is tailored to achieve crystalline and amorphous natures of the PEO coatings. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanoprofilometry techniques are utilized to investigate microstructural and morphological properties of the PEO coatings. XRD studies confirmed that crystalline ceramic phases are obtained at lower silicate concentration while amorphous nature occurred for comparatively higher concentration of silicate in the electrolyte. Nanoindentation technique is utilized to study the mechanical properties such as hardness (H) and Young's modulus (E) of the PEO coatings. The scatter of the data is treated with well-established Weibull statistical method. Finally, in depth corrosion behaviour of the coatings are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization techniques. Amorphous coatings exhibited superior mechanical properties compared to the crystalline coatings. This is possibly linked with the presence of aluminosilicate phases and difference in silicon content in the coatings. However, as expected crystalline PEO coatings offer better corrosion resistance than the amorphous coatings and this behaviour is explained in terms of porosity contents of the coatings.\",\n",

Along with a handful of other sites, the results provide the earliest reliable evidence of permanent regional populations within south-eastern Australia, and support a model in which early colonizers followed the coastal fringe with forays along the main river systems. The evidence is consistent with the demographic model of Williams, 2013 (Proceedings of the Royal Society Series B 280: 20130486), which suggested low, but established regional populations before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a population nadir following the LGM and increasing use of the region from ∼12 to 8 ka.

On the basis of responses from 495 teacher trainees and 224 in-service teachers, the development and validation of an advanced goal orientation measure is presented. Internal consistencies of the goal dimensions were good, and confirmatory factor analyses verified the postulated model for teacher trainees and in-service teachers. In both groups, learning goal orientation positively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and perceived benefits of help-seeking. Performance approach goals positively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and performance avoidance goals negatively predicted self-efficacy for teaching and positively predicted perceived threats of help-seeking. The use of goal orientation facets provided a more thorough analysis of the predictions regarding perceptions of help-seeking.

       "  'abstract': 'As formaldehyde (HCHO) is a high-yield product in the oxidation of most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by fires, vegetation, and anthropogenic activities, satellite observations of HCHO are well-suited to inform us on the spatial and temporal variability of the underlying VOC sources. The long record of space-based HCHO column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is used to infer emission flux estimates from pyrogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the global scale over 2005–2013. This is realized through the method of source inverse modeling, which consists in the optimization of emissions in a chemistry-transport model (CTM) in order to minimize the discrepancy between the observed and mod-eled HCHO columns. The top–down fluxes are derived in the global CTM IMAGESv2 by an iterative minimization algorithm based on the full adjoint of IMAGESv2, starting from a priori emission estimates provided by the newly released GFED4s (Global Fire Emission Database, version 4s) inventory for fires, and by the MEGAN-MOHYCAN inventory for isoprene emissions. The top–down fluxes are compared to two independent inventories for fire (GFAS and FINNv1.5) and isoprene emissions (MEGAN-MACC and GUESSES). The inversion indicates a moderate decrease (ca. 20 %) in the average annual global fire and isoprene emissions, from 2028 Tg C in the a priori to 1653 Tg C for burned biomass, and from 343 to 272 Tg for isoprene fluxes. Those estimates are acknowledged to depend on the accuracy of formalde-hyde data, as well as on the assumed fire emission factors and the oxidation mechanisms leading to HCHO production. Strongly decreased top–down fire fluxes (30–50 %) are inferred in the peak fire season in Africa and during years with strong a priori fluxes associated with forest fires in Ama-zonia (in 2005, 2007, and 2010), bushfires in Australia (in 2006 and 2011), and peat burning in Indonesia (in 2006 and 2009), whereas generally increased fluxes are suggested in Indochina and during the 2007 fires in southern Europe. Moreover, changes in fire seasonal patterns are suggested; e.g., the seasonal amplitude is reduced over southeast Asia. In Africa, the inversion indicates increased fluxes due to agricultural fires and decreased maxima when natural fires are dominant. The top–down fire emissions are much better correlated with MODIS fire counts than the a priori inventory in regions with small and agricultural fires, indicating that the OMI-based inversion is well-suited to assess the associated emissions. Regarding biogenic sources, significant reductions in iso-prene fluxes are inferred in tropical ecosystems (30–40 %), suggesting overestimated basal emission rates in those areas in the bottom–up inventory, whereas strongly positive isoprene emission updates are derived over semiarid and desert areas, especially in southern Africa and Australia. This finding suggests that the parameterization of the soil Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 10134 M. Bauwens et al.: Nine years of OMI-based hydrocarbon emissions moisture stress used in MEGAN greatly exaggerates the flux reduction due to drought in those regions. The iso-prene emission trends over 2005–2013 are often enhanced after optimization, with positive top–down trends in Siberia (4.2 % year −1) and eastern Europe (3.9 % year −1), likely reflecting forest expansion and warming temperatures, and negative trends in Amazonia (−2.1 % year −1), south China (−1 % year −1), the United States (−3.7 % year −1), and western Europe (−3.3 % year −1), which are generally corroborated by independent studies, yet their interpretation warrants further investigation.',\n",

Design Retrospective independent evaluation of dermoscopic images by 2 dermoscopists. Setting A dermatology clinic at a university hospital. Patients Using the files of the clinic from January 1, 2004, through February 28, 2009, we selected cases with CMN lesions affecting acral volar skin that were present at birth or developed within the first few months of life. Main Outcome Measures Characteristic dermoscopic features and their frequencies. Results We collected a total of 24 acral CMN lesions. Dermoscopically, 9 lesions (38%) showed a combination of the crista dotted pattern and the parallel furrow pattern. Of these 9 lesions, 1 also had a fibrillar pattern. The remaining 15 lesions showed the following single-component patterns: the parallel furrow pattern in 6 (25%), the crista dotted pattern in 3 (12%), the fibrillar pattern in 2 (8%), and the globular, globulostreaklike, nontypical, and parallel ridge patterns in 1 each (4%). We also followed up 6 lesions for several years. Changes in the dermoscopic features were observed in 4 CMN lesions from patients younger than 14 years. Three lesions had a combination of the crista dotted and parallel furrow patterns on the first visit that changed to the nontypical pattern; in addition, the degrees of pigmentation decreased during follow-up. In the remaining lesion, the globulostreaklike pattern changed to the parallel furrow pattern. Conclusions Most CMN lesions affecting acral volar skin show characteristic dermoscopic features distinguishable from acral melanoma. The combination of the crista dotted and parallel furrow patterns (ie, peas-in-a-pod pattern) is the most common feature in acral CMN. Some lesions of acral CMN fade during childhood.',\n",

We investigated whether preoperative hydration status after overnight fasting affects interstitial fluid redistribution and thus the magnitude of hypotension during general anesthesia. METHODS: Sixty ASA physical status I/II patients undergoing tympanoplasty fasted from midnight. Anesthesia was induced by fentanyl and propofol and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Coinciding with the induction of anesthesia, 15 mL/kg acetated Ringer solution was infused IV over 60 minutes followed by 1 mL/kg acetated Ringer solution over the next 30 minutes. Urine osmolalities after induction of anesthesia and during the study period (pre-U osm , post-U osm ) and percent decreases of whole-body bioelectrical resistance for extracellular fluid relative to baseline at the end of the study period (ΔR e ) were measured. Patients with a pre-U osm       the 75th percentile of pre-U osm   were categorized in the hydrated or the dehydrated group, respectively. A range of variables, including mean arterial blood pressure during the 30- to 90-minute period relative to baseline, and ΔR e , were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The dehydrated group (pre-U osm   >759.5 mOsm/kg, n = 15) had a lower age (44 vs 52 years, P = 0.049) and had a higher post-U osm   (181 vs 55 mOsm/kg, P = 0.001) compared with the hydrated group (pre-U osm   <378.5 mOsm/kg, n = 15).

CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative dehydration after overnight fasting as measured by urine osmolality did not alter the magnitude of hypotension during general anesthesia. This finding suggests that intravascular volume loading with crystalloid solution to prevent hypotension during general anesthesia is an unfounded practice for low risk patients after overnight fasting.',\n",

Pharmaceutical studies performed with these compounds have found that they have many therapeutic potentialities including anti-cancer, antiviral and antimicrobial properties. However, more interest has been devoted to their antioxidant activity due to the ability to scavenge and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. In this study, gallic acid and 14 different alkyl gallates were tested. The cytotoxicity and anti-herpetic (HSV-1, KOS and 29-R strains) activity were studied by using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay and the cell viability by using the Trypan blue dye exclusion method. The genotoxicity was studied by the Comet assay and the antioxidant activity by using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging and microsomal lipid peroxidation-inhibiting activities. The results showed that all the tested compounds have anti-herpetic activity at non cytotoxic concentrations with selectivity indices (SI = CC50/EC50) varying from 0.89 to 18.34, depending on the used HSV-1 strain. It was observed that all tested alkyl gallates showed some degree of genotoxicity, at the tested concentrations, except cetyl gallate, at 256.60 micromol/L (p <0.05, t-Student test), probably induced by ROS released by infected cells and/or by the alkyl gallates that were not antioxidants, at the tested concentrations, in which they demonstrated anti-herpetic activity. The hydroxyl groups can induce DNA damage due interactions with some metal ions, which are naturally present in the culture medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, probably explaining the genotoxicity detected. However, the obtained results showed considerable antioxidant activity at smaller concentrations, when compared to quercetin which is considered as a reference drug due to its already described antioxidant potential: DPPH radical scavenging activity with IC50 values varying from 17 to 31 micromol/L; and microsomal lipid peroxidation-inhibiting activity with IC50 values varying from 21 to 59 micromol/L. It was observed that the presence of hydroxyl groups in these molecules is important for their pharmacological profile, but the length of the lateral carbonic chain does not have considerable influence.',\n",

Specijically, we extend the model to include the effects of local labormarket conditions on the response of poverty levels to welfare incentives. In contesting the invariance assumption, the expansion method allows us to determine where and in what contexts welfare is “work discouraging.” The empirical analysis, which is undertaken at the county level, indicates that welfare payments va y in their influence on poverty rates across different employment contexts. A national map portraying this parameter instability demonstrates that femalefamily poverty rates are most responsive to welfare assistance in the rural South and least responsive in the metropolitan Northeast. Finally, we examine two sharply contrasting locales to illustrate how poverty is governed by specijic employment and welfare characteristics. The last two decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in both the number and proportion of female-headed families within the poverty population (Pearce 1990). In the heated, ideologically charged debate over the reasons for the feminization of poverty, the conservative position has dominated recently, both in terms of policy and public attitudes. Based on a neoclassical, human-capital perspective, the conservative position maintains that poverty results from the failure of individuals to compete in a free market system that is assumed to provide sufficient employment opportunities for motivated persons. The causes of poverty are thus cast to individuals whose human-capital endowments and/or work efforts fail to proThe authors acknowledge the comments of three anonymous reviewers.

Heat pipes emerge as the most appropriate technology and most thermal effective solution due to their excellent heat transfer capability, heat transfer efficiency and structural simplicity. In many engineering applications higher heat flux is important. Two phase passive devices are proven solutions for modern microelectronics thermal management. This paper attempts to describe the heat transfer characteristics of closed loop pulsating heat pipe (CLPHP) which are new entrants in the family of closed passive two phase heat transfer system. It also shows the comparison of thermal efficiency of CLPHP for different filling ratios with two different working fluids, water and ethanol. This device is a combination of lot of events and mechanisms like bubble nucleation, collapse and agglomeration, bubble pumping action, pressure and temperature perturbations, flow regime changes, dynamic instabilities, meta-stable non equilibrium conditions, flooding, bridging etc. All contribute towards the thermal performance of a device. But, such a complex operating mechanism is not understood well yet and the present state of the art cannot predict the required design parameters for a given task. The aim of research work presented in this paper is to better understand the heat transfer characteristics of these mechanisms through experimental investigations. Experiments are conducted on a CLPHP made of capillary tube of 2.2\\xa0mm inner diameter. The heat transfer characteristics and the performance of the CLPHP are investigated for filling ratios of 100%, 82.5%, 63%, 41.3% and 28%. The results indicate that the performance of this device changes with the changing of working fluid, filling ratios and heat input.',\n",

Strategic GSIT decisions can influence a variety of internal and external organizational stakeholders. GSIT justification and evaluation is critical to organizations, especially those seeking the ecological modernization `win-win' of introducing green technologies into organizations. The literature has seen very few tools and approaches to aid in the explicit justification of strategic GSIT. Although numerous models exist for regular IT, there are certain characteristics including a greater number of factors, especially intangible and socially focused factors, requiring greater investigation of tools for the evaluation and justification process. The identification of appropriate metrics and categorizations to use in advanced strategic appraisal techniques for GSIT is in itself a non-trivial exercise. Thus, in this paper issues facing the strategic justification of GSIT set the stage for introduction of a novel, flexible and comprehensive evaluation approach utilizing a grey systems, fuzzy, and TOPSIS multiple criteria foundation. An illustrative application for evaluating and selecting alternative green data center designs sets the stage for an illustrative example and sensitivity analysis.

The electrical resistivity of concrete is an essential factor describing the ability of a material to conduct current. The addition of discreet Fibers to reinforcing concrete is broadly used due to its advantageous mechanical properties. The rapid spread of concrete microcracks can be reduced or avoided due to the fibres' prepotent tensile strength.

We argue that target judgments in both positive and negative mood may be more or less affected by individuating information depending on whether the target is an ingroup member or an outgroup member. Specifically, in a competitive intergroup setting it should be less congruent with mood-based expectancies when individuals in positive (negative) mood learn that an outgroup (ingroup) member rather than an ingroup (outgroup) member has succeeded. Hence, unexpected (i.e., mood-incongruent) category information should elicit more attention than expected (mood-congruent) category information. More importantly, subsequent individuating information (high vs. low target competence) should be processed more effortful and influence target judgments more strongly given mood-incongruent (vs. mood-congruent) category membership.

However, toxicity can be influenced by the biotransformation of contaminants, including ENPs, as it may alter the fate and transport of these substances. In turn, fate and transport can influence their bioavailability. To understand how biotransformation influences the fate and transport of ENPs in marine ecosystems, we exposed suspension-feeding mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, to two common nano-metal oxides, CeO(2) and ZnO, over a range of concentrations from 1mg L(-1) to 10mg L(-1), in a laboratory experiment. Mussels exposed to 10mg L(-1) accumulated 62μg g(-1) of Ce and 880μg g(-1) of Zn on a dry tissue basis but rejected 21,000μg g(-1) for Ce and 63,000μg g(-1) for Zn in pseudofeces. Scanning electron microscope evidence indicates CeO(2) remained as ENPs but ZnO did not after being rejected by the mussels. Mussels filtered most of the CeO(2) from the aqueous media, while a significant fraction of Zn remained in solution. Differences in ENP solubility affect ENP uptake, excretion, and accumulation in mussels. Our study highlights the potential role of marine suspension feeders in biotransformation of ENPs.',\n",

Exploiting the ΔE-effect, the resonance frequency of the cantilevers is shifted because of a change in the magnetic biasing field. The biasing field, in turn, depends on the applied pressure or strain, respectively. With a view to the application as a reliable sensor, maximum sensitivity but minimum hysteresis in the biasing field/resonance frequency dependence is preferred. In this contribution, monomorph bending cantilevers fabricated using magnetostrictive Fe49Co49V2 and Metglas 2605SA1 are investigated regarding their applicability for future sensors. For this purpose, the biasing field-dependent polarization of the magnetostrictive materials and bending of the cantilevers are determined. Furthermore, a setup to magnetically bias the cantilevers and determine the bending resonance frequency is presented. Here, the resonance frequency is identified by measuring the impulse response employing a laser Doppler vibrometer. The measurement results reveal that cantilevers made of Fe49Co49V2 possess a distinct hysteretic behaviour at low magnetic biasing field magnitudes. This is ascribed to the polarization and bending hysteresis. Cantilevers fabricated using Metglas 2605SA1 feature a lower resonance frequency shift compared to cantilevers with Fe49Co49V2, which would result in a lower sensitivity of the sensor. However, their resonance frequency hysteresis is almost negligible.',\n",

We also discuss kinematic constraints on interacting propagating gauge fields implied by the according spatial coarse-graining, and we explain why the screening physics of an SU(2) photon is subject to an electric- magnetically dual interpretation. This argument relies on the fact that only (anti)calorons of scale parameter ρ ∼| φ| −1 contribute to the coarse-graining required for thermal- ground-state emergence at temperature T. Thus, use of the effective gauge coupling e in the (anti)caloron action is justified, yielding the value for the latter at almost all temperatures. As a consequence, the indeterministic transition of initial to final plane waves caused by an effective, pointlike vertex is fundamentally mediated in Euclidean time by a single (anti)caloron being part of the thermal ground state. Next, we elucidate how a low-frequency excess of line temperature in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) determines the value of the critical temperature of the deconfining-preconfining phase transition of an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory postulated to describe photon propaga- tion, and we describe how, starting at a redshift of about unity, SU(2) photons collectively work 3D temperature depressions into the CMB. Upon projection along a line of sight, a given depression influences the present CMB sky in a cosmologically local way, possibly explaining the large-angle anomalies confirmed recently by the Planck collaboration. Fi- nally, six relativistic polarisations residing in the SU(2) vector modes roughly match the number of degrees of freedom in cosmic neutrinos (Planck) which would disqualify the latter as radiation. Indeed, if interpreted as single center-vortex loops in confining phases of SU(2) Yang-Mills theories neutrino mass mν solely arises by interactions with an en- vironment. Cosmologically, the CMB represents this environment, and thus one would expect that mν = ξT where ξ = O(1). In this model cosmic neutrinos are a small dark- matter contribution, conserved only together with the CMB fluid, influencing Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations during CMB decoupling.',\n",

In the stochastic dynamic game model each agent seeks to minimize its individual quadratic discounted cost function involving the mean of the states of all other agents. In this formulation we derive the limiting infinite population mean field equation system and explicitly compute its unique solution. The resulting mean field (MF) control strategies drive each agent to track the overall population's initial state distribution mean, and by applying these decentralized strategies, any finite population system reaches mean consensus asymptotically as time goes to infinity. Furthermore, these control laws possess an eN-Nash equilibrium property where eN goes to zero as the population size N goes to infinity. Finally, the analysis is extended to the case of random mean field couplings. In the social cooperative formulation the basic objective is to minimize a social cost as the sum of the individual cost functions containing mean field coupling. In this formulation we show that for any individual agent the decentralized mean field social (MF Social) control strategy is the same as the mean field Nash (MF Nash) equilibrium strategy. Hence MF-Nash Controls UNashN=MF - Social Controls USocN. On the other hand, the solution to the centralized LQR optimal control formulation yields the Standard Consensus (SC) algorithm whenever the graph representing the corresponding topology of the network is Completely Connected (CC).

Thus, understanding apical constriction requires characterization of the mechanics and regulation of actomyosin assemblies. We have analyzed the relationship between myosin and the polarity regulators Par-6, aPKC and Bazooka (Par-3) (the PAR complex) during amnioserosa apical constriction at Drosophila dorsal closure. The PAR complex and myosin accumulate at the apical surface domain of amnioserosa cells at dorsal closure, the PAR complex forming a patch of puncta and myosin forming an associated network. Genetic interactions indicate that the PAR complex supports myosin activity during dorsal closure, as well as during other steps of embryogenesis. We find that actomyosin contractility in amnioserosa cells is based on the repeated assembly and disassembly of apical actomyosin networks, with each assembly event driving constriction of the apical domain. As the networks assemble they translocate across the apical patch of PAR proteins, which persist at the apical domain. Through loss- and gain-of-function studies, we find that different PAR complex components regulate distinct phases of the actomyosin assembly/disassembly cycle: Bazooka promotes the duration of actomyosin pulses and Par-6/aPKC promotes the lull time between pulses. These results identify the mechanics of actomyosin contractility that drive amnioserosa apical constriction and how specific steps of the contractile mechanism are regulated by the PAR complex.',\n",

Currently the complexity of the protocol and the amount of hands-on time required for this assay limits its use to low throughput applications; furthermore, variability in antibody quality poses an additional obstacle in scaling up ChIP for large scale screening purposes. To address these challenges, we report HTChIP, an automated microfluidic-based platform for performing high-throughput ChIP screening measurements of 16 different targets simultaneously, with potential for further scale-up. From chromatin to analyzable PCR results only takes one day using HTChIP, as compared to several days up to one week for conventional protocols.

We performed a series of characterization assays to demonstrate that HTChIP can rapidly and accurately evaluate the epigenetic states of a cell, and that it is sensitive enough to detect the changes in the epigenetic state induced by a cytokine stimulant over a fine temporal resolution.

       "  'abstract': 'Many biochemical reactions require controlled recruitment of proteins to membranes. This is largely regulated by posttranslational modifications. A frequent one is S-acylation, which consists of the addition of acyl chains and can be reversed by poorly understood acyl protein thioesterases (APTs). Using a panel of computational and experimental approaches, we dissect the mode of action of the major cellular thioesterase APT2 (LYPLA2). We show that soluble APT2 is vulnerable to proteasomal degradation, from which membrane binding protects it. Interaction with membranes requires three consecutive steps: electrostatic attraction, insertion of a hydrophobic loop and S-acylation by the palmitoyltransferases ZDHHC3 or ZDHHC7. Once bound, APT2 is predicted to deform the lipid bilayer to extract the acyl chain bound to its substrate and capture it in a hydrophobic pocket to allow hydrolysis. This molecular understanding of APT2 paves the way to understand the dynamics of APT2-mediated deacylation of substrates throughout the endomembrane system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Persistence of species in fragmented landscapes depends on dispersal among suitable breeding sites, and dispersal is often influenced by the “matrix” habitats that lie between breeding sites. However, measuring effects of different matrix habitats on movement and incorporating those differences into spatially explicit models to predict dispersal is costly in terms of time and financial resources. Hence a key question for conservation managers is: Do more costly, complex movement models yield more accurate dispersal predictions? We compared the abilities of a range of movement models, from simple to complex, to predict the dispersal of an endangered butterfly, the Saint Francis' satyr (Neonympha mitchellii francisci). The value of more complex models differed depending on how value was assessed. Although the most complex model, based on detailed movement behaviors, best predicted observed dispersal rates, it was only slightly better than the simplest model, which was based solely on distance between sites. Consequently, a parsimony approach using information criteria favors the simplest model we examined. However, when we applied the models to a larger landscape that included proposed habitat restoration sites, in which the composition of the matrix was different than the matrix surrounding extant breeding sites, the simplest model failed to identify a potentially important dispersal barrier, open habitat that butterflies rarely enter, which may completely isolate some of the proposed restoration sites from other breeding sites. Finally, we found that, although the gain in predicting dispersal with increasing model complexity was small, so was the increase in financial cost. Furthermore, a greater fit continued to accrue with greater financial cost, and more complex models made substantially different predictions than simple models when applied to a novel landscape in which butterflies are to be reintroduced to bolster their populations. This suggests that more complex models might be justifiable on financial grounds. Our results caution against a pure parsimony approach to deciding how complex movement models need to be to accurately predict dispersal through the matrix, especially if the models are to be applied to novel or modified landscapes.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This review is concerned with evaluating the toxicity associated with human exposure to silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs), due to the relative abundance of toxicity data available for these particles, when compared to other metal particulates. This has allowed knowledge on the current understanding of the field to be gained, and has demonstrated where gaps in knowledge are. It is anticipated that evaluating the hazards associated with silver and gold particles will ultimately enable risk assessments to be completed, by combining this information with knowledge on the level of human exposure. The quantity of available hazard information for metals is greatest for silver particulates, due to its widespread inclusion within a number of diverse products (including clothes and wound dressings), which primarily arises from its antibacterial behaviour. Gold has been used on numerous occasions to assess the biodistribution and cellular uptake of NPs following exposure. Inflammatory, oxidative, genotoxic, and cytotoxic consequences are associated with silver particulate exposure, and are inherently linked. The primary site of gold and silver particulate accumulation has been consistently demonstrated to be the liver, and it is therefore relevant that a number of in vitro investigations have focused on this potential target organ. However, in general there is a lack of in vivo and in vitro toxicity information that allows correlations between the findings to be made. Instead a focus on the tissue distribution of particles following exposure is evident within the available literature, which can be useful in directing appropriate in vitro experimentation by revealing potential target sites of toxicity. The experimental design has the potential to impact on the toxicological observations, and in particular the use of excessively high particle concentrations has been observed. As witnessed for other particle types, gold and silver particle sizes are influential in dictating the observed toxicity, with smaller particles exhibiting a greater response than their larger counterparts, and this is likely to be driven by differences in particle surface area, when administered at an equal-mass dose. A major obstacle, at present, is deciphering whether the responses related to silver nanoparticulate exposure derive from their small size, or particle dissolution contributes to the observed toxicity. Alternatively, a combination of both may be responsible, as the release of ions would be expected to be greater for smaller particles.',\n",

Among other measures of complexity, the fractal dimension is emerging as being sensitive to neuronal damage secondary to neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here, we calculated Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD) in resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 41 healthy controls (age: 20–89 years) and 67 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients (age: 50–88 years), to investigate whether HFD is sensitive to brain activity changes typical in healthy aging and in AD. Additionally, we considered whether AD-accelerating effects of the copper fraction not bound to ceruloplasmin (also called “free” copper) are reflected in HFD fluctuations. The HFD measure showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with age in healthy people (R2 = .575, p < .001). Onset of HFD decline appeared around the age of 60, and was most evident in central-parietal regions. In this region, HFD decreased with aging stronger in the right than in the left hemisphere (p = .006). AD patients demonstrated reduced HFD compared to age- and education-matched healthy controls, especially in temporal-occipital regions. This was associated with decreasing cognitive status as assessed by mini-mental state examination, and with higher levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper. Taken together, our findings show that resting-state EEG complexity increases from youth to maturity and declines in healthy, aging individuals. In AD, brain activity complexity is further reduced in correlation with cognitive impairment. In addition, elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper appear to accelerate the reduction of neural activity complexity. Overall, HDF appears to be a proper indicator for monitoring EEG-derived brain activity complexity in healthy and pathological aging.',\n",

Methods   Between January 1, 2010 and December 1, 2014, consecutive HCC patients who underwent curative liver resection were enrolled in this study. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent predictive factors of MVI. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare the incidences of MVI and prognosis between patients who did and did not receive preoperative TACE. Factors associated with Disease-Free Survival (DFS) and Overall survival (OS) were identified using Cox regression analyses.   Results   Of 1624 patients, 590 received preoperative TACE. The incidence of MVI was significantly lower in patients with preoperative TACE than those without preoperative TACE (39.15% vs. 45.36%, p = 0.015). After PSM, the incidences of MVI were similar in the two groups (38.85% vs. 41.10%, p = 0.473). Multivariable regression analysis revealed preoperative TACE to have no impact on the incidence of MVI. Before PSM, survival of patients with preoperative TACE was significantly worse than those without preoperative TACE (p = 0.032 for DFS and p = 0.027 for OS). After PSM, the difference became insignificant (p = 0.465 for DFS and p = 0.307 for OS). After adjustment for other prognostic variables in the propensity-matched cohort, preoperative TACE was still found not to be associated with DFS and OS after HCC resection. Both before and after PSM, the prognosis of patients was not significantly different between the two groups for BCLC stages 0, A, and B.   Conclusions   Preoperative TACE did not influence the incidence of MVI and prognosis of patients with HCC who underwent 'curative' liver resection.\",\n",

We investigated whether adult S mice without wheels remain DIO-resistant when exposed - via the mother - to the HE diet during their perinatal stage (from 2weeks prior to conception until weaning on post-natal day 21). While S1 and S2 females subjected to HE diet either perinatally or from weaning onwards (post-weaning) resisted increased adiposity at adulthood (as opposed to CON females), they lost this resistance when challenged with HE diet during these periods combined over one single cycle of breeding. When allowed one-week access to wheels (at week 6-8 and at 10months), however, tendency for increased wheel-running behavior of S mice was unaltered. Thus, the trait for increased wheel-running behavior remained intact following combined perinatal and post-weaning HE exposure, but apparently this did not block HE-induced weight gain. At weaning, perinatal HE diet increased adiposity in all lines, but this was only associated with hyperleptinemia in S lines irrespective of gender. Because leptin has multiple developmental effects at adolescence, we argue that a trait for increased physical activity may advance maturation in times of plenty. This would be adaptive in nature where episodes of increased nutrient availability should be exploited maximally. Associated disturbances in glucose homeostasis and related co-morbidities at adulthood are probably pleiotropic side effects.',\n",

Moreover, the harms caused by air pollution have a more pernicious reach, such as being the major source of climate change and ‘natural disasters’, which reportedly kills millions of people each year (World Health Organization, 2012). The opening quotations tell a story of the UK government's complacency towards the devastation of toxic and contaminating air emissions. The above headlines greeted the British public earlier this year after its government was taken to the Court of Appeal for an appalling air pollution record that continues to cause the premature deaths of 30,000 British people each year at a health cost estimated at £20 billion per annum. This combined with pending legal proceedings against the UK government for air pollution violations by the European Commission, point to a Cameron government that prioritises hot air and profit margins over human lives. The UK's legal air pollution regimes are an industry dominated process that relies on negotiation and partnership between regulators and polluters. The entire model seeks to assist business compliance rather than punish corporate offenders. There is no language of ‘crime’ in relation to UK air pollution violations but rather a discourse of ‘exceedence’ (Walters, 2010). It is a regulatory system not premised on the ‘polluter pay’ principle but instead the ‘polluter profit’ principle.\",\n",

The MEDIMACS project is an academically funded, prospective, randomized, controlled and mechanistic clinical trial designed to address the effects of an active randomized intervention with the Mediterranean diet on atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, coronary endothelial dysfunction and other mechanistic endpoints. One hundred patients with ACS are randomized 1:1 to a monitored high-intensity Mediterranean diet intervention or to a standard-of-care arm. Adherence to diet is assessed in both arms using food frequency questionnaires and biomarkers of compliance.

Mesenchymal stem cells have gained recent popularity as a regenerative therapy since they possess immunomodulatory functions. We found that injected adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) reside in the liver. Injection of ADSCs also restores albumin expression in hepatic parenchymal cells and ameliorates fibrosis in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis model of cirrhosis in mice. Gene expression analysis of the liver identifies up- and down-regulation of genes, indicating regeneration/repair and anti-inflammatory processes following ADSC injection. ADSC treatment also decreases the number of intrahepatic infiltrating CD11b+ and Gr-1+ cells and reduces the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ cells in hepatic inflammatory cells. This is consistent with down-regulation of genes in hepatic inflammatory cells related to antigen presentation and helper T-cell activation.

       "  'abstract': 'We aimed at highlighting the role of ZNF217, a Kruppel-like finger protein, in Estrogen Receptor-α (ERα)-positive (ER+) and luminal breast cancers. Here we report for the first time that ZNF217 and ERα proteins bind to each other in both breast cancer cells and breast tumour samples, via the ERα hinge domain and the ZNF217 C-terminal domain. ZNF217 enhances the recruitment of ERα to its estrogen response elements (ERE) and the ERα-dependent transcription of the GREB1 estrogen-regulated gene. The prognostic power of ZNF217 mRNA expression levels is most discriminatory in breast cancers classified with a \"good prognosis\", particularly the Luminal-A subclass. A new immunohistochemistry ZNF217 index, based on nuclear and cytoplasmic ZNF217 staining, also allowed the identification of intermediate/poor relapse-free survivors in the Luminal-A subgroup. ZNF217 confers tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells and is a predictor of relapse under endocrine therapy in patients with ER+ breast cancer. ZNF217 thus allows the re-stratification of patients with ER+ breast cancers considered as cancers with good prognosis where no other biomarkers are currently available and widely used. Here we propose a model in ER+ breast cancer where ZNF217-driven aggressiveness incorporates ZNF217 as a positive enhancer of ERα direct genomic activity and where ZNF217 possesses its highest discriminatory prognostic value.',\n",

The native conformation of the heme cavity in these globins, both its proximal and distal parts, was shown to be sustained by a system of hydrogen bonds involving the proximal and distal protein residues, the heme propionates, and the nearby polar amino acids on the protein surface (His, Arg, Lys). The hydrogen bond network in the proximal part of the heme pocket controls the position of the Fe atom either outside or within the protoporphyrin plane, which affects the efficiency of ligand binding. In the distal part, the hydrogen bond network formed with the distal protein residue involved (HisE7 in swMb, hhMb, and giHbI and GlnE7 in lpHbII), should stabilize the conformation in which the protein can donate hydrogen to the O2 ligand. The hydrogen bond between the E7 distal residue and O2 ligand prevents rapid dissociation of the latter and plays an important role in the regulation of ligand affinity. The hydrogen bond networks found in the proximal and, especially, in the distal heme environments, must be disrupted when oxyglobin binds to the membrane surface. This disruption caused by interaction of negatively charged phospholipid heads with lysine or arginine residues exposed towards the membrane, altered local pH near the membrane, and the effect of negative electrostatic field of the membrane, can decrease the affinity of the protein for the O2 ligand, thus facilitating its dissociation at the physiological pO2 values in the cell.',\n",

To address this issue, this study compared perceived price sensitivity across smoking status (daily and non-daily) and within ethnicity (Hispanic and non-Hispanic White) in a recent representative population survey of California smokers. METHODS This study employed data from the 2008 California Tobacco Survey (CTS), a large population-based random-digit-dialed telephone survey. Participants were 1,777 non-Hispanic White and 450 Hispanic respondents who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes and currently smoked daily or on some days. RESULTS Differences in perceived price sensitivity were found by ethnicity when controlling for age, gender, and cigarette consumption. Comparisons across ethnic groups indicated that Hispanic smokers, in general, have more price-sensitive perceptions than non-Hispanic White smokers. However, daily versus non-daily status had no effect on price sensitivity when controlling for cigarette quantity. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that pricing increases may be differentially influential for Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic White smokers across smoking status categories.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is due to the unremitting accumulation of neoplastic CD5 B cells in blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. The prognosis of patients with this form of leukemia is extremely variable, from a normal life span in cases with smoldering disease not requiring intervention, to a short survival in those with aggressive disease unresponsive to treatment. Management of these latter patients constitutes a major challenge. As with many other blood cancers resistant to conventional treatment, at the end of the last century, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations were investigated as a means of controlling CLL refractory to treatment. The first reports were published in 1991 and consisted of a small retrospective series of patients. The results were encouraging for disease control but disappointing regarding treatment-related mortality, which was of around 50%. Despite this, many studies on allogeneic transplantations in CLL ensued, results somewhat improved, and ultimately transplantations became an accepted, albeit not satisfactory, tool in the treatment of CLL with poor prognosis. Importantly, in the last decade results of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations have dramatically improved. This has been mainly possible thanks to a better selection of candidates for transplantation, a refined selection of donors, improvements in supportive care, and the use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC; nonmyeloablative) regimens that allow engraftment while sparing nonhematopoietic cells from myeloablativerelated toxicity. CLL is the paradigm of the diseases in which RIC allotransplantations are effective. This is due to the low proliferative capacity of the disease and its sensitivity to the graft-versusleukemia (GVL) effect. As shown by minimal residual disease studies, a complete and, importantly, durable clearance of leukemic cells develops over time in a substantial proportion of patients, suggesting the cure of the disease. Altogether these achievements have led to a substantial reduction of the early death rate (ie, death within the first 100 days after transplantation) to less than 5%, and made allotransplantation accessible to older patients who represent the majority of the CLL population. However, long-term nonrelapse mortality after allotransplantation for CLL still remains in the 15% to 25% range, mainly because of graft-versus-host disease; this mandates a careful selection of patients who might benefit from this procedure. Notably, allogeneic transplantations are effective across genetically defined high-risk subsets, such as CLL with del(17p)/ TP53 mutations and unmutated IGHV genes. For all these reasons, allogeneic transplantation is considered a standard option for carefully selected patients with high-risk CLL, particularly if not responding to standard treatments. However, in most studies the relapse rate is 30% to 45% at 5 years post transplantation, implying that disease recurrence has become the most important cause of failure after allotransplantation. In case of disease relapse after transplantation, patients’ outcome is a major concern. A rather generalized opinion has been that prognosis of these patients is dismal. This idea, however, derives from older studies in which heavily pretreated patients were allografted as a last, desperate attempt to control the disease. This, coupled with myeloablative conditioning regimens, led to a meager tolerance to further and, at that time, no effective salvage treatments. Today, however, patients progressing after transplantation can be rescued by a variety of treatment approaches. In the article accompanying this editorial, Rozovski et al report for the first time a systematic analysis of patients with CLL progressing after allotransplantation. In their retrospective study of 72 patients (52 with CLL, 20 with disease-transformation or Richter’s syndrome), most patients (92%) had active disease at the time of transplantation, 22 (31%) had never achieved response, and 50 (69%) had a response but experienced relapse after a median of 7 months (range, 2-85 months), all this delineating aggressive disease. Other poor prognostic factors at diagnosis were del(17p) (29%) and unmutated IGHV status (84%). Most patients had received RIC regimens. The median time from transplantation to relapse was 7 months (range, 7-87 months). Patients received a variety of treatments, reflecting that there is no a standard of care for CLL progressing after transplantation; in most cases, however, rescue treatment included anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

The study was carried out in Oran, Argentina. A total of 99 stool samples from a local surveillance campaign were analyzed by concentration microscopy and McMaster egg counting technique compared to the analysis by multi-parallel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This study compared the performance of qPCR assay and stool microscopy for 8 common intestinal parasites that infect humans including the helminths Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, and the protozoa Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and Entamoeba histolytica, and investigated the prevalence of polyparasitism in an endemic area. qPCR showed higher detection rates for all parasites as compared to stool microscopy except T. trichiura.

This new version takes advantage of the   cfitsio   and   HEALPix   libraries to propose   fits   output maps using the   HEALPix   pixelisation scheme. Skymaps for       γ     -ray and       ν       signals from generic annihilation/decay spectra are now direct outputs of   CLUMPY . Making use of   HEALPix   routines, smoothing by a user-defined instrumental Gaussian beam and computing the angular power spectrum of the maps are now possible. In addition to these improvements, the main novelty is the implementation of a Jeans analysis module, to obtain dark matter density profiles from kinematic data in relaxed spherical systems (e.g., dwarf spheroidal galaxies). The code is also interfaced with the   GreAT   toolkit designed for Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, from which probability density functions and credible intervals can be obtained for velocity dispersions, dark matter profiles, and       J     -factors.

       "  'abstract': 'We previously demonstrated that fermitin family member 1 (FERMT1) was significantly overexpressed in colon cancer (CC) and associated with poor metastasis-free survival. This study aimed to investigate the precise role of FERMT1 in CC metastasis and the mechanism by which FERMT1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Correlations between FERMT1 and EMT markers (E-cadherin, Slug, N-cadherin and β-catenin) were examined via immunohistochemistry in a cohort of CC tissues and adjacent normal colon mucosae. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to elucidate the function of FERMT1 in CC metastasis and underlying mechanisms. The upregulated expression of FERMT1 in CC tissues correlated positively with that of Slug, N-cadherin and β-catenin, but correlated inversely with E-cadherin expression. Altered FERMT1 expression led to marked changes in the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT markers of CC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Investigations of underlying mechanisms found that FERMT1 interacted directly with β-catenin and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation level of β-catenin, enhancing β-catenin nuclear translocation and increasing the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/TCF/LEF. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by CHIR99021 reversed the effect of FERMT1 knockdown, whereas inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by XAV939 impaired the effect of FERMT1 overexpression on EMT and cell motility. In conclusion, findings of this study suggest that FERMT1 activates the β-catenin transcriptional activity to promote EMT in CC metastasis.',\n",

Methods   We searched multiple electronic databases for peer-reviewed journal articles related to pediatric SDB and executive functioning. We included studies that assessed SDB via polysomnography, included objective or questionnaire measures of executive function, and had an age-matched control group. Fourteen articles met inclusion criteria with a total sample of 1697 children ages 5 to 17 years (M=9.81 years; SD=0.34). We calculated an overall effect size for each of the five executive domains (vigilance, inhibition, working memory, shifting, and generativity) as well as effect sizes according to SDB severity: mild, moderate, severe. We also calculated effect sizes separately for objective and subjective questionnaires of executive functioning.   Results   We found a medium effect size (-0.427) for just one of five executive function domains on objective neuropsychological measures (generativity). In contrast, effect sizes on all three executive domains measured via questionnaire data were significant, with effect sizes ranging from medium (-0.64) to large (-1.06). We found no difference between executive domains by severity of SDB.   Conclusions   This meta-analysis of executive function separated into five domains in pediatric SDB suggested lower performance in generativity on objective neuropsychological measures. There were no differences associated with SDB severity. Questionnaire data suggested dysfunction across the three executive domains measured (inhibition, working memory, shifting). Overall, limited evidence suggested poorer performance in executive function in children with SDB according to objective testing, and subjective ratings of executive function suggested additional worsened performance.

       "  'abstract': 'Intraguild predation (IGP) is a type of biological interaction involving the killing and consuming of competing species that exploit similar and often limited resources. This phenomenon is widespread among a great variety of taxonomic groups and has already been reported for mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae. Moreover, the larvae of certain mosquito species of the tribe Sabethini have evolved modified mouthparts ending in rigid apical structures signaling their capacity to be effective intraguild predators. We assumed that IGP confers a selective advantage under severe competitive conditions by both providing an immediate energetic gain and reducing potential competition. Because potential competition is likely to increase with decreasing habitat size, we hypothesized that the proportion of species with modified mouthparts would increase in smaller aquatic habitats. We tested this hypothesis by examining the mosquito species naturally associated with phytotelmata of decreasing sizes in French Guiana. We show that the degree of specialization in mosquito-phytotelm associations is high, suggesting a long coevolutive process. Indeed, short-term interaction experiments confirmed that species with modified mouthparts are able to prey upon similarly-sized intraguild prey and are, thus, effective intraguild predators. In addition, these species are larger and associated with smaller phytotelmata than those with typical mouthparts. Moreover, below a certain threshold of phytotelm size, only species with modified mouthparts were present. These results show that IGP confers a selective advantage under severe competitive conditions and results from the coadaptation of mosquito species to their specific phytotelm habitat. The presence of functionally analogous structures in different mosquito genera also implies that IGP has emerged from convergent evolution in small phytotelmata.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     The authors’ volume-of-fluid based electrokinetic flow model for multiphase flow with fluid–fluid interfaces, recently extended by them to allow for interfacial charge, is refined and more comprehensively validated under dynamic conditions. Validation is performed using (i) an analytical solution for drop relaxation in the presence of ions and interfacial charge, and (ii) published experimental observations of the shape evolution of a critically charged water droplet in air, undergoing Rayleigh instability. Predictions based on two methods of representing the electrical force, in combination with two different numerical treatments of the interfacial charge, are compared. It is shown that the most accurate predictions, when there is interfacial charge, are obtained by using a “modified pressure” formulation (in which part of the Maxwell stress is incorporated into the pressure) in combination with a published treatment for solving the Poisson equation for the electrical potential that is similar to the Ghost Fluid Method; this is therefore the recommended model combination. The choice of method (modified pressure or standard formulation) is found to be unimportant when there is no interfacial charge. Finally, the recommended model is used to predict the steady state deformation of a hexadecane drop in an electrolyte solution during pressure-driven flow through a cylindrical microchannel, when both the channel wall and the drop interface carry electric charge. It is shown that, for low interfacial tension, electrokinetic forces can significantly enhance or reduce the drop deformation, compared with that of a drop with no interfacial charge, when the charges on the drop interface and channel wall are of the same or opposite sign, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Normal avian plasma glucose levels are 1.5-2 times greater than mammals of similar size. In mammals, hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Prior work has shown that mourning doves have high levels of antioxidants and isolated vessels have low endogenous oxidative stress. Therefore, the hypothesis was that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated avian arteries would not be impaired following acute exposure to high glucose. Isolated small resistance cranial tibial arteries (c. tibial) were cannulated and pressurized in a vessel chamber then incubated with either normal or high glucose (20mM vs. 30mM) for 1h at 41°C. Vessels were then pre-constricted to 50% of resting inner diameter with phenylephrine (PE) followed by increasing doses of acetylcholine (ACh; 10(-9) to 10(-5)M, 5min per step). Percent vasodilation was measured by tracking the inner diameter with edge-detection software. Contrary to our hypothesis, ACh-induced vasodilation was impaired with acute exposure to high glucose (p=0.013). The impairment was not related to increased osmolarity since vasodilation of arteries exposed to an equimolar combination of 20mM d-glucose and 10mM l-glucose was not different from controls (p=0.273). Rather, the impaired vasodilation was attributed to oxidative stress since superoxide levels were elevated 168±42% (p=0.02) and pre-exposure of arteries to the superoxide dismutase mimetic tiron (10mM) improved vasodilation (p<0.05). Therefore, isolated arteries from doves do not have endogenous mechanisms to prevent impaired vasodilation resulting from high glucose-mediated increases in oxidative stress.',\n",

Proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) serine/threonine kinase signaling takes part in various pathways exerting tumorigenic properties. We hypothesized that the combination of a PIM kinase inhibitor with an mTOR inhibitor might have complementary growth-inhibitory effects against AML. The simultaneous inhibition of the PIM kinase by pan-PIM inhibitor AZD1208 and of mTOR by selective mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor AZD2014 exerted anticancer properties in AML cell lines and in cells derived from primary AML samples with or without supportive stromal cell co-culture, leading to suppressed proliferation and increased apoptosis. The combination of AZD1208 and AZD2014 rapidly activated AMPKα, a negative regulator of translation machinery through mTORC1/2 signaling in AML cells; profoundly inhibited AKT and 4EBP1 activation; and suppressed polysome formation. Inhibition of both mTOR and PIM counteracted induction of heat-shock family proteins, uncovering the master negative regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the dominant transcription factor controlling cellular stress responses. The novel combination of the dual mTOR inhibitor and pan-PIM inhibitor synergistically inhibited AML growth by effectively reducing protein synthesis through heat shock factor pathway suppression.',\n",

Makhlaseh components were identified via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Total phenolic content (TPC), alkaloids, tannins and saponins were determined. Antioxidant activity was determined calorimetrically for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity. Antimicrobial effect of extracts was evaluated by five methods, pour plate, well diffusion, disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).

For the polymer preparation, an amine-thiol-ene conjugation process was used to combine N-(allyloxy)carbonyl homocysteine thiolactone monomer with different amines, which simultaneously released a thiol group for subsequent thiol-ene radical polymerization. Results of the European standard formaldehyde release test by the flask method indicated that the obtained polymers with higher amine loadings resulted in a greater reduction in formaldehyde concentration. Urea-formaldehyde adhesive was overcoated with scavenging polymers, which resulted in a significant reduction in formaldehyde emissions. The amine-functionalized polymers were characterized by NMR and DSC before and after exposure to formaldehyde. After exposure to formaldehyde, polymers exhibited additional proton peaks in the NMR spectra and their glass transition temperature increased, which implied that formaldehyde was bound to the polymers.',\n",

Here we combine published studies with new genetic, morphological and habitat data that were collected from seahorse populations located along the European and North African coastlines to help inform management decisions for European seahorses. This study confirms the presence of only two native seahorse species (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus) across Europe, with sporadic occurrence of non-native seahorse species in European waters. For the two native species, our findings demonstrate that highly variable morphological characteristics, such as size and presence or number of cirri, are unreliable for distinguishing species. Both species exhibit sex dimorphism with females being significantly larger. Across its range, H. guttulatus were larger and found at higher densities in cooler waters, and individuals in the Black Sea were significantly smaller than in other populations. H. hippocampus were significantly larger in Senegal. Hippocampus guttulatus tends to have higher density populations than H. hippocampus when they occur sympatrically. Although these species are often associated with seagrass beds, data show both species inhabit a wide variety of shallow habitats and use a mixture of holdfasts. We suggest an international mosaic of protected areas focused on multiple habitat types as the first step to successful assessment, monitoring and conservation management of these Data Deficient species.',\n",

Rainfall, after water stress, enhanced on-tree mature green fruit to develop translucent flesh disorder more frequently. Thus, this research pursued the effect of applied water on translucent flesh disorder development. The on-tree mature green stage fruits were selected and wrapped with 3 layers of fabric sheet. After that, water was continuously dropped (flow rate of 0.6\\u2009ml/min) on the wrapped sheet for 0, 1, and 2 days before picking. The results showed that duration time of water applying enhanced the increasing of water absorption significantly in peel. All of water-treated fruits ripened within 2-3 days after harvest and obviously had high lignin in secondary cell wall. It was hypothesized that lignification played an important role in hypoxia defense mechanism since the Na2CO3-SP fractionation extracted from alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) of translucent flesh aril was higher than those of normal aril. This Na2CO3-SP reinforced the strength of cell wall complexity as well as displaying the translucency character. Hence, we concluded that the capillary water (took place in intercellular air space of fruit pericarp) induced hypoxia tolerance mechanism that triggered translucent flesh disorder in mangosteen aril.',\n",

Dispersed generation systems, such as wind farms and photovoltaic power plants, require particular attention due to their incorporation of uncertain energy sources.

In this case, many new technical considerations must be addressed to take into account the impacts of these uncertainties on the planning and operation of distribution networks. This paper proposes novel Bayesian-based approaches to forecast the power production of wind and photovoltaic generators and phase load demands. These approaches are used in a probabilistic short-term steady-state analysis of a Smart Grid obtained by means of a probabilistic load flow performed using the Point Estimate Method.

The stability over time of a diagnosis of ASD is theoretically interesting and important for various diagnostic and clinical reasons. We studied the diagnostic stability of ASD from childhood to early adulthood in the Faroe Islands: a total school age population sample (8–17-year-olds) was screened and diagnostically assessed for AD in 2002 and 2009. This paper compares both independent clinical diagnosis and Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) algorithm diagnosis at two time points, separated by seven years. The stability of clinical ASD diagnosis was perfect for AD, good for “atypical autism”/PDD-NOS, and less than perfect for Asperger syndrome (AS). Stability of the DISCO algorithm subcategory diagnoses was more variable but still good for AD. Both systems showed excellent stability over the seven-year period for “any ASD” diagnosis, although a number of clear cases had been missed at the original screening in 2002. The findings support the notion that subcategories of ASD should be collapsed into one overarching diagnostic entity with subgrouping achieved on other “non-autism” variables, such as IQ and language levels and overall adaptive functioning.',\n",

We examined the relationship between several metacognitive processes and anxiety disorder diagnostic status in a sample of 98 youth aged 7-17 years. Twenty youth with GAD were compared with similarly sized groups of youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, n = 18), social phobia (SOC, n = 20), separation anxiety disorder (SAD, n = 20), and healthy controls who were not patients (NONP, n = 20) using a self-report measure of metacognition adapted for use with young people in this age range (Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children). Contrary to expectations, only one specific metacognitive process was significantly associated with an anxiety disorder diagnosis, in that the controls endorsed a greater degree of cognitive monitoring (self-reported awareness of one's thoughts) than those with SAD. In addition, there was a trend indicating that nonpatients scored higher than youth with GAD on this scale. These surprising results suggest potentially differing patterns in the relationships between symptoms and metacognitive awareness in anxious youth, depending on the type of anxiety disorder presentation.\",\n",

Vascular complications were defined as groin bleeding (hematoma, hemoglobin decrease ≥3 g/dl, transfusion, retroperitoneal bleeding, or arterial perforation), pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula formation, obstruction, or infection. Patients with postprocedure femoral vascular access complications were compared to randomly selected patients without complication. Data were available for 9,108 procedures, of which PCI was performed in 3,172 (34.8%). MC was performed in 2,581 (28.3%) and VCDs (4 different types) were deployed in 6,527 procedures (71.7%). Significant complications occurred in 74 procedures (0.81%), with 32 (1.24%) complications with MC and 42 (0.64%) with VCD (p = 0.004). VCD deployment failed in 80 procedures (1.23%), of which 8 (10%) had vascular complications. VCD use was a predictor of fewer complications (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.83). In the case–control analysis, older age and use of large (7Fr to 8Fr) femoral sheaths were independent predictors of complications.

The poor prognosis arises from a lack of sensitive biomarkers, limited therapeutic options, and the astonishingly high recurrence rate after surgery of 60-80%. The factors driving this recurrence, however, remain enigmatic. Therefore, we generated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from early- and late-recurrent PDAC patients. Cellular identity of PDOs was confirmed by qPCR, ddPCR, and IHC analyses. This is the first study investigating the metabolism in PDOs of different, clinically significant PDAC entities by untargeted GC/MS profiling. Partial least square discriminant analysis unveiled global alterations between the two sample groups. We identified nine metabolites to be increased in early recurrent PDOs in comparison to late recurrent PDOs. More than four-times increased were fumarate, malate, glutamate, aspartate, and glutamine. Hence, α-keto acids were elevated in PDO-conditioned medium derived from early recurrent patients. We therefore speculate that an increased anaplerotic metabolism fuels the Krebs-cycle and a corresponding higher accessibility to energy fastens the recurrence in PDAC patients. Therein, a therapeutic intervention could delay PDAC recurrence and prolong survival of affected patients or could serve as biomarker to predict recurrence in the future.',\n",

Therefore, approaches designed to protect oligodendrocytes would likely have therapeutic value. Activation of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) signaling in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress increases cell survival under various cytotoxic conditions. Moreover, there is evidence that PERK signaling is activated in oligodendrocytes within demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis and EAE. Our previous study demonstrated that CNS delivery of the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ before EAE onset protected mice against EAE, and this protection was dependent on PERK signaling. In our current study, we sought to elucidate the role of PERK signaling in oligodendrocytes during EAE. We generated transgenic mice that allow for temporally controlled activation of PERK signaling, in the absence of ER stress, specifically in oligodendrocytes. We demonstrated that persistent activation of PERK signaling was not deleterious to oligodendrocyte viability or the myelin of adult animals. Importantly, we found that enhanced activation of PERK signaling specifically in oligodendrocytes significantly attenuated EAE disease severity, which was associated with reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. This effect was not the result of an altered degree of the inflammatory response in EAE mice.

A significant residual stress may lead to micro-cracks in the film or cause the film to peel off the substrate. Therefore, in this work, the biaxial residual stress states of a SOFC anode with various spraying conditions by using the “sin2ψ” technique of the XRD method were studied. The results show that the NiO/LDC coating on the porous Ni substrate with high temperature displayed the lowest compressive residual stress. The compressive residual stress in the NiO/LDC anode decreases with the increase of the Ni substrate temperature during the plasma spraying. In addition, the coating thickness didn't show the obvious effect on the residual stress. Moreover, the compressive stress will promote the tendency of coatings to debond or curve all the cell components.\",\n",

The effects of catalyst performance, reactor temperature, steam, and reaction type on gas yield, gas composition, and carbon conversion efficiency are discussed.

Based on this linear relationship, a predicted model of isobaric heat capacity for liquid refrigerants was presented. The accurate isobaric heat capacity of refrigerants in liquid phase can be obtained if the critical temperature, critical pressure, critical density, acentric factor and several experimental isobaric heat capacity data (at least two, more is better) are known. The proposed model was applied to 17 refrigerants (including HC, HFC, HFO and HCFO refrigerants) and a comparison was performed between the calculations by the proposed model and the experimental heat capacity data to validate the prediction. The results indicated the proposed method can represent the isobaric heat capacity of 17 refrigerants in liquid state with an average absolute deviation of 1.00%. The performance of this proposed method was then compared with that of other models (including Helmholtz equation, Peng-Robinson equation and a generalized corresponding state principle equation). It can be concluded that the proposed method generally shows better performance than other models. In addition, the proposed model reveals a good extrapolation ability in low temperature regions for refrigerants.',\n",

Our objective was to systematically evaluate the literature for best practices of ERAS elements in abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC), to determine if there is sufficient evidence to create best practice guidelines for this procedure.   Materials and methods   Following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement, we performed a review using Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Eligible articles contained ERAS components and postoperative outcomes of ASC published in English since 1997. Thirty-five full-text articles were selected for final qualitative analysis.   Results   Poor functional status before ASC was associated with a longer length of hospital stay. Laparoscopic ASC was associated with a shorter postoperative hospital stay, with no difference between laparoscopic and robotic approaches. Epidural analgesia in addition to spinal anesthesia lowered levels of pain throughout the postoperative stay in laparoscopic ASC. A multimodal bowel regimen shortened time to first bowel movement compared to a single agent regimen. Removing a Foley catheter may lead to sooner first spontaneous void but may result in higher rates of urinary retention and urinary tract infection. Studies investigating preoperative bowel preparation, preanesthesia medication, and multidose antimicrobial prophylaxis did not show significant benefit.   Conclusions   Best practices for ASC can be developed based on current findings from the literature and extrapolation of evidence from other surgeries where ASC-specific elements are missing, with the ability to modify the pathways as new data become available.',\n",

Similarly, the number of co-morbidities was associated with fatal disease [OR 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4-8.0), for cases with at least four co-morbidities vs no co-morbidities] and 79% of fatal cases had at least two co-morbidities.

Methods   Apparently healthy and drug-free local adult Chinese were recruited by completing health questionnaires.

Among all bacterial pathogens,   Legionella pneumophila   maintains the largest known set of translocated substrates, delivering over 300 proteins to the host cell via its Type IVB, Icm/Dot translocation system. Backed by a few notable examples of effector–effector regulation in   L.\\xa0pneumophila , we sought to define the extent of this phenomenon through a systematic analysis of effector–effector functional interaction. We used   Saccharomyces cerevisiae , an established proxy for the eukaryotic host, to query >\\xa0108,000 pairwise genetic interactions between two compatible expression libraries of ~330\\xa0 L.\\xa0pneumophila‐ translocated substrates. While capturing all known examples of effector–effector suppression, we identify fourteen novel translocated substrates that suppress the activity of other bacterial effectors and one pair with synergistic activities. In at least nine instances, this regulation is direct—a hallmark of an emerging class of proteins called metaeffectors, or “effectors of effectors”. Through detailed structural and functional analysis, we show that metaeffector activity derives from a diverse range of mechanisms, shapes evolution, and can be used to reveal important aspects of each cognate effector9s function. Metaeffectors, along with other, indirect, forms of effector–effector modulation, may be a common feature of many intracellular pathogens—with unrealized potential to inform our understanding of how pathogens regulate their interactions with the host cell.',\n",

Cases when AR varies from 1 to 8 are carried out. In the pyrolysis zone of the cooling channel, decreasing the channel aspect ratio can reduce the temperature difference and non-uniformity of fuel conversion in the channel cross section, and it can also increase the final conversion and corresponding chemical heat absorption.

The genomic structure of the chicken peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (cPPARγ) gene has not been fully characterized, and only one cPPARγ gene mRNA sequence has been reported in genetic databases. Using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we identified five different cPPARγ mRNAs that are transcribed from three transcription initiation sites. The open reading frame analysis showed that these five cPPARγ transcript variants (cPPARγ1 to 5) could encode two cPPARγ protein isoforms (cPPARγ1 and cPPARγ2), which differ only in their N-terminal region. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that, of these five cPPARγ transcript variants, cPPARγ1 was ubiquitously highly expressed in various chicken tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, kidney, spleen and duodenal; cPPARγ2 was exclusively highly expressed in adipose tissue; cPPARγ3 was highly expressed in adipose tissue, kidney, spleen and liver; cPPARγ4 and cPPARγ5 were ubiquitously weakly expressed in all the tested tissues, and comparatively, cPPARγ5 was highly expressed in adipose tissue, heart, liver and kidney.

In contrast to the zoea I of P. elegans, first-stage larvae of M. amazonicum are nonfeeding. At hatching, the morphology of the mandibles is fully expressed in P. elegans, while it appears underdeveloped in M. amazonicum, presenting only small precursors of typical caridean features. In successive zoeal stages, both species show similar developmental changes, but the mandibular characters of the larvae in M. amazonicum were delayed compared to the equivalent stages in P. elegans, especially in the development of submarginal setae and mandible size. In conclusion, our results indicate heterochrony (postdisplacement) of mandible development in M. amazonicum compared to that in P. elegans, which is related to initial lack of mandible functionality or planktivorous feeding at hatching, respectively. This conclusion is supported by comparison with other palaemonid zoeae exhibiting different feeding modes. Our data suggest that an evolutionary ground pattern of mandible morphology is present even in species with nonfeeding first-stage larvae. J.

Recent studies of arthropods have used gene arrangements in the mitochondrial (mt) genome to infer phylogenies, but for copepods, only seven complete mt genomes have been published. These data revealed several within-order and few among-order similarities. To increase the data available for comparisons, we sequenced the complete mt genome (13,831base pairs) of Amphiascoides atopus and 10,649base pairs of the mt genome of Schizopera knabeni (both in the family Miraciidae of the order Harpacticoida). Comparison of our data to those for Tigriopus japonicus (family Harpacticidae, order Harpacticoida) revealed similarities in gene arrangement among these three species that were consistent with those found within and among families of other copepod orders. Comparison of the mt genomes of our species with those known from other copepod orders revealed the arrangement of mt genes of our Harpacticoida species to be more similar to that of Sinergasilus polycolpus (order Poecilostomatoida) than to that of T. japonicus. The similarities between S. polycolpus and our species are the first to be noted across the boundaries of copepod orders and support the possibility that mt-gene arrangement might be used to infer copepod phylogenies. We also found that our two species had extremely truncated transfer RNAs and that gene overlaps occurred much more frequently than has been reported for other copepod mt genomes.',\n",

The infective larvae of T. canis are one of the causes of visceral larva migrans (VLM), a clinical syndrome in humans. Diagnosing VLM is difficult, and the differential diagnosis of the larval development stage is limited. Therefore, this experimental research aimed to diagnose T. canis larvae using a molecular method, not only in liver tissue, which is the most commonly affected tissue, but also in the limb muscles, lungs and brain tissues. For this purpose, 24 BALB/c mice were infected with 1000 embryonated T. canis eggs. Necropsies were performed on the second, fourth, seventh and 14th days post-infection. While a part of the samples were digested with pepsin-HCl, the molecular method was used for the remainder of the samples to replicate the mitochondrial DNA adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase subunit-6 gene region of T. canis. BbsI, a restriction endonuclease, was used to determine the specificity of the amplicons obtained from Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection limit for embryonated eggs was recorded.

For a precise assessment of sensor degradation, the TOA reflectance time series is usually corrected for surface and atmospheric anisotropy by using bidirectional reflectance models so that the angular effects do not compromise the trend estimates. However, the models sometimes fail to correct the angular effects, particularly for spectral bands that exhibit a large seasonal oscillation due to atmospheric variability. This paper investigates the use of time series algorithms to identify both the angular effects and the atmospheric variability simultaneously in the time domain using their periodical patterns within the time series. Two nonstationary time series algorithms were tested with the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper time series data acquired over two pseudoinvariant desert sites, the Sonoran and Libyan Deserts, to compute a precise long-term trend of the time series by removing the seasonal variability. The trending results of the time series algorithms were compared to those of the original TOA reflectance time series and those normalized by a widely used bidirectional-reflectance-distribution-function model. The time series results showed an effective removal of seasonal oscillation, caused by angular and atmospheric effects, producing trending results that have a higher statistical significance than other approaches.',\n",

While analog radiography of pottery (X-radiography, Xeroradiography, etc.) has functioned as a common disciplinary tool for some time, inaccessibility, obsolescence, and significantly enhanced functionality have made DR instrumentation increasingly attractive and vital. This article presents the theoretical underpinnings, technique development, and resultant protocols that allow digital radiography to analyze very large assemblages and provide quantitative data sets that act as true counterparts to geochemical and mineralogical ones. As a technique of structural pottery evaluation, DR is particularly suited to the analysis of ceramic paste preparation and vessel formation, providing lines of evidence that can flesh out neglected portions of the chaine operatoire, augment existing geochemical or typological classifications, and help more deeply characterize various potting traditions. Such datasets are most useful to scholars interested in harnessing the ability of the pottery “life cycle” to shed light on economic life, learning frameworks, and human social differences and group identities. The technical capacities and analytical potential of DR are demonstrated through several test analyses of ancient Chinese pottery, to be followed by more extensive case studies in draft.

The predicting future motions, however, is very challenging because the future cannot be deterministically known a priori and there are infinitely many possible future trajectories. Prediction becomes far more challenging when trying to foresee distant future. This paper proposes a probabilistic motion prediction algorithm that can accurately compute the likelihood of multiple target lanes and trajectories of surrounding vehicles by using the artificial neural network; more specifically radial base function network (RBFN). The RBFN prediction algorithm estimates the likelihood of each lane being the driver’s target lane in categorical distributions and the corresponding future trajectories in parallel. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction algorithm, it is applied for the predictive cruise control problem. Chance-constrained model predictive control (CCMPC) is utilized because the chance constraints in CCMPC can handle collision uncertainties associated with future uncertainties from the proposed prediction algorithm. The RBFN-based CCMPC simulation is conducted for several risky cut-in scenarios and compared with the state-of-the-art Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)-based prediction algorithm. The simulation results show that the RBFN-based CCMPC achieves higher collision avoidance success rate than that of the IMM-based CCMPC while using smaller actuator inputs and providing higher passenger comforts. Furthermore, the RBFN-based CCMPC showed high robustness to false braking during near lane-change (lane-keeping) scenarios.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rhamnolipids are one of the most effective biosurfactants that are of great interest in industrial applications such as enhancing oil recovery, health care, cosmetics, pharmaceutical processes, food processing, detergents for protein folding, and bioremediation due to their unique characteristics such as low toxicity, surface active property to reduce surface/interfacial tensions, and excellent biodegradability. The genes and metabolic pathways for rhamnolipid synthesis have been well elucidated, but its cost-effective production is still challenging. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most powerful rhamnolipid producer, is an opportunistic pathogen, which limits its large scale production and applications. Rhamnolipid production using engineered strains other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa such as E. coli and Pseudomonas putida has received much attention. The highest yield of rhamnolipids is achieved when oil-type carbon sources are used, but using cheaper and renewable carbon sources such as lignocellulose would be an attractive strategy to reduce the production cost of rhamnolipids for various industrial applications.',\n",

This work infers that the representation of performance matrices of a matching network like sensitivity and harmonic rejection; in terms of input reflection coefficient (S 11) is more convenient than the transfer functions. Expression of S 11 of widely used L-, ?- and T-networks have been derived as a function of inductor quality factor (Q L ), capacitor quality factor (Q C ) and transformation ratio. This formulation shows that the matching performance degrades severely due to component non-idealities. To circumvent this degradation, a modified set of design equations have been proposed for the L-network and the same has been extended for ?- and T-network. Simulation results show that network synthesized on the basis of proposed set of equations nullify the effect of non-idealities by 70---80% in L-network and 10---20% in ?-network but minor improvement in T-network.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Abstract 4400       BACKGROUND:   Cord-blood transplantation (CBT) is an effective option for both malignant and non-malignant hematological diseases and its increasing number in the last years has enlarged the frequency of the use of cord-blood units (CBUs) trough international borders in order to maximize the opportunity of identifying optimal CB unit. Since there is no global standard regarding cord-blood quality control, the quality of CBUs can be affected by the bank of origin. In addition, few information are disposable on the cord blood engraftment capacity after long-term cryopreservation. In this study, we evaluated whether the origin and the age of CBUs may influence the quality of CBUs and post-transplant hematological recovery.       METHODS:   CBTs with single unit were performed at San Martino Hospital in Genoa for hematological malignancies using an intra-bone cord blood transplant technique. Just before infusion, a small sample of the CBU was obtained and post-thawing number of total nucleated cells (TNCs), CD34 positive cells, and colony-forming cells (CFCs) were characterized. Median pre-freezing number of TNCs and CD34-positive cells were 2.32 (1.15 – 4.52) × 109 and 9.3 (2.4 – 27.24) × 106, respectively. Recovery of neutrophil and platelet were compared according to the origin and the age of each CBU.       RESULTS:   95 CBUs were tested. The bank of origin of CBUs was Europe (n = 45), the United States (n = 40), and other regions (n = 10). Median age of CBUs was 4.9 (0.4 – 11.8) years; CBUs originated from European bank were significantly older than CBUs from other regions (5.9 years vs 3.8 years, p value of unpaired t-test     4.9 years) CBUs or younger CBUs ( Figure   1,3). Hematological recovery was not influenced by the bank origin of CBUs as well, namely, rate and time of neutrophil and platelet engraftment was, 22 and 34.5 days (Europe), 22 and 35 days (the United States), 24 and 42 days (the other region), respectively ( Figure   2,4).       CONCLUSION:   Although in our experience time of cryopreservation of CBUs was significantly dependent from bank of origin, the origin and the age of CBUs have little impact on post-thawing values of TNCs, CD34 positive cells, and CFCs. In addition, hematological recovery after transplant was not influenced by the origin or by the age of CBU. These data suggest that quality control of CBU is working well regardless of the bank origin.       Disclosures:   No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.

In Angola, maternal mortality remains high and the risk of pregnancy-related death was 1 in 32 during 2015. This study aims to identify demographic and social factors influencing antenatal care and health facility delivery among women in Dande and to understand their impact on birth outcomes.   Methods   This study is based on community-based longitudinal data collected by the Dande Health and Demographic Surveillance System between 2009 and 2015. Data on pregnancy outcomes (10,289 outcomes of 8,066 women) were collected for all reported pregnancies, including sociodemographic information, health services utilisation and women's reproductive history. Logistic regression was used to investigate the determinants of birth outcomes, antenatal care attendance and institutionalised delivery.   Findings   Of the 10,289 pregnancy outcomes, 98.5% resulted in live births, 96.8% attended antenatal care, and 82.5% had four or more visits. Yet, 50.7% of the women delivered outside a health facility. Antenatal care attendance was a determinant of birth outcomes (stillbirth: unadjusted OR = 0.34 95% CI = 0.16-0.70; abortion: OR = 0.07 95% CI = 0.04-0.12). Older women, with lower education, living at a greater distance of a health facility and in rural areas, were less likely to use maternal health care. Having had previous pregnancies, namely resulting in live births, also decreased the likelihood of health care utilization by pregnant women.   Conclusions   The study identifies relevant social determinants for the utilisation of antenatal care, place of delivery and their impact on birth outcome, thereby providing insight on how best to address inequities in health care utilization.\",\n",

Numerous studies have indicated that abnormal maintenance of telomere is related to the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapy. Based on these facts, we designed a lot of compounds and conducted large scale screening. In this study, we identified a small molecule compound IX, an imatinib derivative, as a potential therapeutic candidate of drug-resistant leukemia treatment. IX can eradicate drug-resistant leukemia cells or LSCs, while has little effect on the normal progenitor cells in vitro. We also showed that IX can relive the tumor burden of CML xenograft mice model and prolong the life span of them. Meanwhile, it can inhibit the abnormal elongation of telomere not only by effectively decreases the telomerase activity of drug-resistant leukemia cells, but also by affecting ALT mechanism. Besides, the suppression of Wnt signaling pathway by IX may plays an important role in eradicating drug-resistant cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that IX could be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of refractory leukemia.',\n",

These junctions are connected directly with transmembrane desmosomal cadherins, desmogleins (Dsgs) and desmocollins (Dscs), mainly Dsg1/Dsc1 and Dsg3/Dsc3 in desmosomes and Dsg1/Dsc1 with corneodesmosin in corneodesmosomes. Dsgs and Dscs are associated with several proteins at their inner cytoplasmic domains to anchor keratin intermediate filaments. Desmosomes are not static, but dynamic units that undergo regular remodeling to allow for keratinocyte outward-migration in the epidermis. Recently, two mutually-reversible desmosomal adhesion states have been recognized, i.e., \"stable hyper-adhesion (Ca2+-independent)\" and \"dynamic weak-adhesion (Ca2+-dependent)\". A remarkable impairment of this remodeling is observed in pemphigus vulgaris (an autoimmune blistering disease), caused by anti-Dsg3 antibodies, generating a weak-adhesion desmosome state. Immediately after formation, corneodesmosomes normally commit to degradation, which is complicatedly regulated by proteolytic cleavage of their respective extracellular portion(s), via kallikrein-regulated peptidases and cathepsins. This proteolytic activity is in turn controlled by a variety of inhibitory agents, including protease inhibitors, cholesterol sulfate, and an acidic gradient. The impairment of protease control causes keratinization disorders. This review focuses on the dynamic regulation of desmosomes and corneodesmosomes in relation to keratinization disorders.',\n",

It is also of great importance the integration of dDAQ in control and measurement networks. This paper analyzes the applicability of the IEEE1588 and EPICS standards to solve these problems, and presents a hardware module implementation based in both of them that allow adding these functionalities to any DAQ. The IEEE1588 standard facilitates the integration of event timing and synchronization mechanisms in distributed data acquisition systems based on IEEE 803.3 (Ethernet). An optimal implementation of such system requires the use of network interface devices which include specific hardware resources devoted to the IEE1588 functionalities. Unfortunately, this is not the approach followed in most of the large number of applications available nowadays. Therefore, most solutions are based in software and use standard hardware network interfaces. This paper presents the development of a hardware module (GI2E) with IEEE1588 capabilities which includes USB, RS232, RS485 and CAN interfaces. This permits to integrate any DAQ element that uses these interfaces in dDAQ systems in an efficient and simple way. The module has been developed with Motorola's Coldfire MCF5234 processor and National Semiconductors's PHY DP83640T, providing it with the possibility to implement the PTP protocol of IEEE1588 by hardware, and therefore increasing its performance over other implementations based in software. To facilitate the integration of the dDAQ system in control and measurement networks the module includes a basic Input/Output Controller (IOC) functionality of the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) architecture. The paper discusses the implementation details of this module and presents its applications in advanced dDAQ applications in the fusion community.\",\n",

ABA also exists in the aquatic algal progenitors of land plants, but other than its involvement in stress responses, its physiological role in these microorganisms remains elusive. We show that exogenous ABA significantly altered the HCO3− uptake of Chamydomonas reinhardtii in a light-intensity-dependent manner. In high light ABA enhanced HCO3− uptake, while under low light uptake was diminished. In the dark, ABA induced a negative geotropic movement of the algae to an extent dependent on the time of sampling during the light/dark cycle. The algae also showed a differential, light-dependent directional taxis response to a fixed ABA source, moving horizontally towards the source in the light and away in the dark. We conclude that light and ABA signal competitively in order for algae to position themselves in the water column to minimise photo-oxidative stress and optimise photosynthetic efficiency. We suggest that the development of this response mechanism in motile algae may have been an important step in the evolution of terrestrial plants and that its retention therein strongly implicates ABA in the regulation of their relevant tropisms.',\n",

The prepared nanosorbents were characterized by FTIR spectral analysis that provided spectral evidences for interactions between the chitosan and alginate biopolymers, and binding of arsenic ions with the nanosorbent. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the size of nanosorbent fell into the range of 20–110\\u202fnm whereas the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated almost spherical morphology of the nanosorbents. The size of the nanosorbents was determined by dynamic light scattering measurements which also confirmed the nanosize of the sorbent particles. The nanosorbents were employed for removal of arsenic ions from aqueous solutions and the effect of various experimental conditions such as varying metal ion concentration, pH and temperature of the metal ion solutions, doses of the nanosorbent, and chemical composition of the nanosorbents were studied on the percent removal of arsenic ions. The adsorption data was applied to Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models, and the kinetics of the adsorption process was also studied.

In the long-term follow-up of these patients, severe post-transplant infections, relapse or secondary malignancies may be directly related to prolonged immune defects, especially in the context of innovative stem cell sources such as umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) (1) or transplants from HLA haplo-identical family donors (Haplo-HSCT) (2, 3).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Frontiers Research Topic provides insights into mechanisms of immune reconstitution in an allogeneic environment, in order to improve monitoring and therapeutic intervention in allo-HSCT patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nForcina et al. (4) critically review T and NK biomarkers, their threshold and clinical relevance. Many factors from the host, transplant conditioning, stem cell source, and genetic disparity may impact immune recovery. Few biomarkers have reached a clinical consensus: a rapid and potent CD4 T-cell recovery is associated with a favorable clinical outcome, CMV-specific CD8 T-cell counts measured by tetramers can predict a lower incidence of CMV disease. Other phenotypic or molecular markers, still based on small-sized studies, will need further validation in large scale-multicentric cohorts. This is the case of molecular markers of lymphocyte generation, such as T-cells evaluated by the quantification of T-cell rearrangement excision circles (TREC) as a surrogate marker of thymic activity. Clave et al. (3) indicate an impact of thymic function recovery on relapse following CBT as well as Haplo-HSCT in children treated for an hematological malignancy. In order to reach the routine medical practice, immunomonitoring tests need also to be simple and fast. This practical issue is well taken into account by Fuji et al. (5) reviewing T-cell monitoring of viral and fungal infections. CMV is still the most intensively studied virus in immunocompromised hosts. CMV shapes T and NK cell responses in many ways and may escape immune response. Among still unanswered questions, is the role of viral-specific (CMV and EBV) T-cell cross-reactivity against allogeneic targets in graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukemia (6).\\r\\n\\r\\nExperimental models have proved their importance in allo-HSCT, especially deciphering mechanisms of allogeneicity in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Among rodents, rat models are relevant especially in some autoimmune conditions and solid organ transplantation, sometimes closer to the human disease than the “gold standard” murine models. Zinocker et al. (7) emphasize the interest of rat model in experimental GVHD, especially the rat skin explant assay as a tool for functional evaluation of GVHD. Experimental models are also required to provide the basis and for preclinical evaluation of immune-based therapies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Frontiers Research Topic also reviews in some strategies already proposed in the clinics. Adoptive T-cell therapies have been conducted successfully by several groups to control life-threatening viral (EBV, CMV) reactivations. This leads to “off the shelf” strategies based on third party HLA-typed T-cell donors registries, which may have a major impact in transplant recipients (8). The development of therapeutic antibodies in cancer is one of the most active fields in clinical immunology. Many strategies are underway to improve their action, especially through their antibody-dependent cellular toxicity mediated by natural killer (NK) cells (9). One approach especially relevant in allo-HSCT would be to take advantage of the killer-immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand incompatibility in addition to ADCC to boost NK functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of these different concepts, from basic knowledge to translational medicine, is integrated in state-of-the art reviews of two main “success stories” in allo-HSCT: CBT (1) and Haplo-HSCT (2).',\n",

The in situ growth of (NH4)2V10O25·8H2O urchin-like hierarchical structures delivers a specific capacitance of 1530 F g−1 at a current density of 1.5 A g−1, and retains 95.1% of the initial capacitance after 10\\u2006000 cycles, owing to the advantages of the urchin-like hierarchical structure such as more active sites for electrochemical reactions, as well as a shortened diffusion length for the charge carriers due to a binder-free effect, which exceeds that of most recently reported vanadates and polyvanadates.

Advanced stage, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), age above 60, high International Prognostic Index score, and treatment without radiotherapy for the bone involved were significant poor prognostic factors for OS of all patients in univariate analysis. There was a trend toward better OS not only in limited-stage but also in advanced-stage patients with radiotherapy for the bone involved compared with the patients without radiotherapy. Elevated LDH level and age above 60 were the independent unfavorable prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.Elevated LDH level and age above 60 predict the poor prognosis of patients with bone involvement.

       "  'abstract': 'In the last decade, increases in both soil temperature and active layer thickness have been observed in the central Lena River basin, an area located in the centre of continuous permafrost in the Eurasian continent. Increased soil temperatures have been accompanied by corresponding increases in soil moisture within the active layer at many sites throughout the region. These underground hydro-thermal changes are believed to be primarily due to perennially wet climate conditions, rather than the atmospheric warming alone that has resulted in abnormally large amounts of winter snow accumulation and late summer rainfall in the Lena River basin. This study aimed to clarify the linkage between atmospheric and land surface variations in regions of continuous permafrost in eastern Siberia based on in situ observation and atmospheric climatic data analyses. These wet conditions in 2004–2008 were likely caused by the enhancement of cyclones over the Arctic Ocean and eastward propagation of storm activity during late summer and early winter. Water vapour flux was enhanced in conjunction with the manifestation of precipitation in eastern Siberia. As a result, consecutive positive anomalies of winter snow accumulation and precipitation during the subsequent summers effectively humidified land surfaces in the permafrost region from 2005 onwards, which resulted in abrupt soil warming and wetting of both the active layer and the upper part of the permafrost. The positive effects on increasing soil temperatures of both snowfall in winter and rainfall in summer have been observed in eastern Siberia since the 1990s, and have also been demonstrated through land surface simulation. Results of these hydro-climatic changes indicated that the near-surface permafrost in eastern Siberia is vulnerable to the climatic conditions that have arisen due to the acceleration of the hydrological cycle that has resulted from the aforementioned period of warming.',\n",

Design   Experimental study.   Methods   The CAMA 2.0 computer-animated model of accommodation and presbyopia was produced in collaboration with an experienced medical animator using Autodesk Maya animation software and Adobe After Effects.   Results   The computer-animated model demonstrates the configuration and synchronous movements of all accommodative elements. A new classification of the zonular apparatus based on structure and function is proposed. There are 3 divisions of zonular fibers; that is, anterior, crossing, and posterior. The crossing zonular fibers form a scaffolding to support the lens; the anterior and posterior zonular fibers work reciprocally to achieve focused vision. The model demonstrates the important support function of Weiger ligament. Dynamic movement of the ora serrata demonstrates that the forces of ciliary muscle contraction store energy for disaccommodation in the elastic choroid. The flow of aqueous and vitreous provides strong evidence for our understanding of the hydrodynamic interactions during the accommodative cycle. The interaction may result from the elastic stretch in the choroid transmitted to the vitreous rather than from vitreous pressue. The model supports the concept that presbyopia results from loss of elasticity and increasing ocular rigidity in both the lenticular and extralenticular structures.

Environmental stress can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and dynamic changes including reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, as well as mitophagy impairment, which leads to increased ROS, inflammatory responses and cellular senescence. Oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular senescence all have important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In this review, we discuss the current state on how mitochondrial dysfunction affects inflammatory responses and cellular senescence, the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction underlying the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases and the potential of mitochondrial transfer and replacement as treatments for these diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and other residual anisotropic NMR parameters provide valuable structural information of high quality and quantity, bringing detailed structural models of flexible molecules in solution in reach. The corresponding data interpretation so far is directly or indirectly based on the concept of a molecular alignment tensor, which, however, is ill-defined for flexible molecules. The concept is typically applied to a single or a small set of lowest energy structures, ignoring the effect of vibrational averaging. Here, we introduce an entirely different approach based on time averaged molecular dynamics with dipolar couplings as tensorial orientational restraints that can be used to solve structural problems in molecules of any size without the need of introducing an explicit molecular alignment tensor into the computation. RDC restraints are represented by their full 3D interaction tensor in the laboratory frame, for which pseudo forces are calculated using a secular dipolar Hamiltonian as the target. The resulting rotational averaging of each individual tensorial restraint leads to structural ensembles that best fulfil the experimental data. Using one-bond RDCs, the approach has been implemented in the force field procedures of the program COSMOS and extensively tested. A concise theoretical introduction, including the special treatment of force fields for stable and fast MD simulations, as well as applications regarding configurational analyses of small to medium-sized organic molecules with different degrees of flexibility, is given. The observed results are discussed in detail.',\n",

Homecare nurses are actors of choice in meeting these challenges, yet they need means of identifying frail and complex patients in their routine practice. The fraXity study’s aim is to fill this gap by (1) proposing frailty and complexity computation algorithms derived from the interRAI-HC; (2) assessing the predictive validity of the proposed indices with respect to adverse health outcomes; and (3) identifying subgroups of the aged population for whom the early screening of frailty and complexity appears to be most relevant. The study will rely on a prospective observational case-control longitudinal study. Three samples of individuals aged 65 or older living in the community will be considered: recipients of formal home care (case 1), of formal home assistance (case 2) and individuals free of formal home services (controls). All participants will receive interRAI-HC assessments at three measurement occasions, separated by six-month intervals. Baseline assessments will serve to derive frailty and complexity scores. Follow-ups will serve to assess the predictive validity of the proposed indices and to estimate the intra-individual change in frailty and complexity. Group comparisons will serve to identify subgroups of the population for whom the screening of frailty and complexity appears to be the most relevant. The expected results of the fraXity study are a) reliable computation algorithms for frailty and complexity scores derived from the interRAI-HC and b) clinical assessment protocols for use by homecare nurses.

To investigate the hepatic physiology of tiger puffer in response to a moderately high level of dietary lipid, a 74-day feeding trial was conducted, followed by a hepatic transcriptome assay. Two experimental diets which had an optimal (10.44%, Control) or moderately higher (14.64%, high-lipid diet, HL) dietary lipid level was formulated. Each diet was fed to triplicate tanks. No significant difference was observed in growth and feed efficiency between the two groups, but the survival was significantly lower in group HL. The HL diet also resulted in significantly higher lipid accumulation in liver, which was reflected in the hepatic histology. The biochemical parameters in serum confirmed the existence of stress in liver caused by high lipid intake. A total of 63 differentially expressed genes between groups were observed in the hepatic transcriptome assay, which were primarily enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms such as Endopeptidase activity, Secretion, and Organic acid transport, as well as in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways such as Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and DNA replication. The HL diet tended to inhibit the protein synthesis and secretion in liver, and this was evidenced by activities/concentrations of selected proteins secreted into intestine. Genes related to liver protection and repair were transcriptionally stimulated by diet HL. In conclusion, compared to the optimal lipid requirement, a moderately higher lipid level in the diet for tiger puffer did not compromise the growth performance, but tended to inhibit the protein secretion function of liver and stimulate the processes related to liver protection and repair. The present results will be beneficial to both feed management in tiger puffer farming and elucidation of lipid metabolism characteristics in fish which store lipid in liver.',\n",

Comprehensive characterizations of the genomic landscapes have been completed recently for several tumors, glioblastoma being among the first ones. Our own translational research studies have been focused on defining molecular subtypes of glioblastoma in the clinical setting because of an expected prognostic and therapeutic utility of the information. Somatic mutations in genes of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme family appear to be among the best-defined biomarkers that also influence tumor behavior and confer clinical utility. Methods We have reviewed the literature including our own results to summarize basic science and clinical correlates of IDH mutations. Results The surveyed data reveal genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and biochemical consequences of IDH mutations in the context of glioblastoma biology and phenotype. In addition, a few studies highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting IDH, although thus far all tests have only been conducted in the preclinical setting. Conclusion Somatic mutations in isoforms of IDH genes represent important biomarkers that correlate with biochemical, biological and phenotypic features of glioblastoma, and may also facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies complementing the currently available approved protocols.',\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the cardiac alterations caused by all-trans- retinoic acid (ATRA) in normal adult rat hearts are physiologic or pathologic and if these alterations are dose-dependent.       Methods   Rats were allocated into a control group that received a diet without ATRA ( n   = 16), a group that received 0.3 mg of ATRA/kg of diet ( n   = 17), a group that received a diet containing 10 mg of ATRA/kg ( n   = 18), or a group that received 50 mg of ATRA/kg in the diet ( n   = 18). After 4 wk, the animals were evaluated echocardiographically, morphologically, and biochemically.       Results   The 50-mg ATRA group presented cardiac hypertrophy with maintenance of cardiac geometry and increased systolic function, whereas diastolic function was similar to that of the control group. In addition, progressive increases in the ATRA dose resulted in gradual augmentations of left atrial diameter, left ventricular diastolic and systolic diameters, left ventricular mass index, cardiac output, cardiac index, and aortic velocity. The ATRA did not produce alterations in interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α cardiac levels, interstitial collagen volume fraction, or the intensity and localization of connexin-43. In addition, no alteration was observed in β-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, or citrate synthase, suggesting that cardiac energetic metabolism was preserved with ATRA.       Conclusion   These results suggest that ATRA produced dose-dependent effects and cardiac remodeling that is more compatible with a physiologic response.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Ferromagnetic materials are widely used in engineering structures. Damages caused during manufacture and the use of ferromagnetic materials may seriously undermine the safety of the engineering structure, and even lead to serious industrial accidents. For the early damage testing problem of ferromagnetic materials, it is imperative to propose and adopt new nondestructive testing methods. The metal magnetic memory (MMM) method, which is also known as the micromagnetic testing method, can achieve the early detection of damages in ferromagnetic materials such as steels. However, due to the lack of the quantitative research, the MMM method is only applicable for damage localization. In this paper, the MMM method is utilized to quantitatively evaluate the stress and crack in ferromagnetic materials. The inverse model including the objective function and optimization parameters is proposed. The reconstruction approach is established based on the conjugate gradient inversion method and the exact line search algorithm. In the theoretical analysis, the effectiveness of the MMM method in quantitative determination regarding the position and size of defects is verified with the experimental signal of a hole defect. Following this, the theoretical analyses of localization and sizing of stress and crack are conducted by using the simulation results as the measured signals. It can be found from the results that the MMM method can be applicable for quantitative evaluation of surface rectangular cracks, surface stress concentration zone, convex-type defect, and so on. In addition, the influences of the signal selection, sampling rate, lift-off value, stress level, and noise amplitude on the quantitative analysis of early stress concentration are discussed in details.',\n",

The TTI increases with the thermal aging time, and the peak heat release rate (pHRR) decreases for aged cables. Thermal aging can modify the chemical compositions and structures, leading to further changes in combustion. The higher heat flux caused a higher HRR and a lower burning duration for the studied new and aged cables. The difference in TTI and pHRR for new and aged cables is insignificant for higher external heat fluxes. Finally, the prominent effect of thermal aging on emissions and residues was highlighted using varying external heat fluxes.

In this paper, a deep analysis of this algorithm has been carried out in order to cover this gap. From this analysis, we propose a new approach to the OLLA, the enhanced OLLA (eOLLA), which is able to adaptively modify its step size as well as to update its offset according to the reception conditions even if no data packets have been received. Thus, for LTE- and LTE-A-realistic scenarios, simulation results show that the proposed eOLLA outperforms the traditional OLLA, achieving a performance gain of up to a 15 % in terms of throughput.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Site selection is a complex process for owners and analysts. This process involves not only technical requirements, but also economical, social, environmental and political demands that may result in conflicting objectives. Site selection is the process of finding locations that meet desired conditions set by the selection criteria. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi Criteria Evaluation techniques (MCE) are the two common tools employed to solve these problems. However, each suffers from serious shortcomings and could not be used alone to reach an optimum solution. This poses the challenge of integrating these tools. Developing and using GIS-based MCE tools for site selection is a complex process that needs well trained GIS developers and analysts who are not often available in most organizations. In this paper, a GIS-based multicriteria evaluation site selection tool is developed in ArcGIS 9.3 using COM technology to achieve software interoperability. This tool can be used by engineers and planners with different levels of GIS and MCE knowledge to solve site selection problems. A typical case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed tool. In addition, the paper presents a comprehensive discussion of the site selection process and characteristics.',\n",

In this study, a male sterile mutant, K305ms, was derived from the M3 progeny of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line K305 exposed to 60Co-γ irradiation. Male sterile K305ms plants did not show any obvious differences from their sibling male fertile plants (K305F) during the vegetative stage, but failed to produce functional pollen at the reproductive stage. Microscopic observations determined that the dyads and tetrads from the pollen of K305ms plants developed abnormally, and subsequently the microspores were shriveled. Genetic analysis indicated that the male sterility of K305ms was controlled by a single recessive genic gene.

In fact, the required accuracy is usually brought by the inclusion of nonlinearities, which are often time-consuming to compute. This paper provides a computationally efficient meshless nonlinear Froude–Krylov model, including nonlinear kinematics and an integral formulation of drag forces in six degrees of freedom, which computes almost in real-time. Moreover, a mooring system model with three lines is included, with each line comprising of an anchor, a jumper, and a clump weight. The mathematical model is used to investigate the highly-nonlinear phenomenon of parametric resonance, which has particularly detrimental effects on the energy conversion performance of the spar-buoy oscillating water column (OWC) device. Furthermore, the sensitivity on changes to jumper and clump-weight masses are discussed. It is found that mean drift and peak loads increase with decreasing line pre-tension, eventually leading to a reduction of the operational region. On the other hand, the line pre-tension does not affect power production efficiency, nor is it able to avoid or significantly limit the severity of parametric instability.',\n",

Of interest, it is well documented that patients with schizophrenia, at least as a group, do not show reductions in their state experience of pleasant stimuli. However, there is emerging evidence to suggest that individuals with schizotypy--defined as the personality organization reflecting the latent vulnerability for schizophrenia--do show these state deficits. This is paradoxical in that schizophrenia reflects a more pathological state in virtually every conceivable domain as compared with schizotypy. The present study examined self-reported affective reactions to neutral-, bad-, and good-valenced stimuli in individuals with psychometrically defined schizotypy and schizophrenia. Two separate control groups were also included, comprising psychometrically defined controls and stable outpatients with affective disorders. With no exceptions, the schizotypy group reported significantly less pleasant affect for each of the three conditions than each of the other groups. Conversely, the schizophrenia group did not statistically differ from the control groups for any of the conditions. Within both the schizotypy and schizophrenia groups, severity of negative symptoms/traits was associated with less pleasant report. We found that individuals with prominent negative symptoms and traits from the schizophrenia and schizotypy groups resembled each other in terms of state anhedonia. The present findings did not appear to reflect comorbid depression or anxiety. Our discussion centers on this apparent paradox in the schizophrenia spectrum--that individuals with schizotypy exhibit state anhedonia, whereas patients with schizophrenia do not.',\n",

To assess the extent of this breakdown in a UV complete framework we study string-theoretic effects on nice slices in Schwarzschild black holes. Our purpose is two-fold. First, we use nice slices to address various open questions and caveats of [1] where it was argued that boost-enhanced non-adiabatic string-theoretic effects at the horizon could provide a dynamical mechanism for the firewall. Second, we identify two non-adiabatic effects on nice slices in Schwarzschild black holes: pair production of open strings near the horizon enhanced by the presence of the infinite tower of highly excited string states and a late-time non-adiabatic effect intrinsic to nice slices.',\n",

Alleles of AA, AG, and GG were determined for rs10757274 (polymorphism-1) and rs2383206 (polymorphism-2) polymorphisms located in chromosome 9p21 from the blood samples. RESULTS There was a significant difference between the alleles in polymorphism-1 in the presence of coronary artery disease (38.9% in AA, 48.0% in GG and 56.4% in AG, p=0.017). However, there was no difference between the alleles in polymorphism-2.

       "  'abstract': 'Hemidesmosomes are specialized cell-matrix adhesion structures that are associated with the keratin cytoskeleton. Although the adhesion function of hemidesmosomes has been extensively studied, their role in mechanosignaling and transduction remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that keratinocytes lacking hemidesmosomal integrin α6β4 exhibit increased focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, and traction-force generation. Moreover, disruption of the interaction between α6β4 and intermediate filaments or laminin-332 results in similar phenotypical changes. We further demonstrate that integrin α6β4 regulates the activity of the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulator YAP through inhibition of Rho-ROCK-MLC- and FAK-PI3K-dependent signaling pathways. Additionally, increased tension caused by impaired hemidesmosome assembly leads to a redistribution of integrin αVβ5 from clathrin lattices to focal adhesions. Our results reveal a novel role for hemidesmosomes as regulators of cellular mechanical forces and establish the existence of a mechanical coupling between adhesion complexes.',\n",

Therefore, it is interesting to globally identify the lncRNAs altered in HCC. In our study, we used microarray to profile the levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs in three pairs of HCC and their adjacent noncancerous samples. We found lncRNA-SVUGP2, which is a splice variant of the UGP2 gene, was down-regulated in HCC samples and correlates with a better prognosis in patients with HCC. Overexpression of lncRNA-SVUGP2 in HepG2 and Hep3B liver cancer cells suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, lncRNA-SVUGP2 suppresses the invasion ability of liver cancer cell lines and downregulates the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2 and 9. Additionally, lncRNA-SVUGP2 positively or negatively correlates with many mRNAs in liver cancer tissues, indicating it is multifunctional in regulating carcinogenesis.',\n",

To understand the mechanical properties of microtubules in living cells, we developed an orthotropic-Kelvin like model and investigated the vibrational behavior when they are embedded in surrounding elastic medium. We considered them as orthotropic elastic shell and its surrounding elastic matrix as Kelvin model. We found that due to mechanical coupling of these components with the elastic medium, the flexural vibration is increased and radial frequencies in all modes are increased considerably while other vibrational modes are not affected that much.',\n",

PPARγ coactivator 1 (PGC-1) coactivators possess an extensive range of biological effects in different tissues, and play a key part in the regulation of the oxidative metabolism, consequently modulating the production of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Owing to these findings, a large body of studies, aiming to establish the role of PGC-1 in the neuromuscular system, has shown that PGC-1 could be a promising target for therapies targeting neuromuscular diseases. Among these, some evidence has shown that various signaling pathways linked to PGC-1α are deregulated in muscular dystrophy, leading to a reduced capacity for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In the light of these results, any intervention aimed at activating PGC-1 could contribute towards ameliorating the progression of muscular dystrophies. PGC-1α is influenced by different patho-physiological/pharmacological stimuli. Natural products have been reported to display modulatory effects on PPARγ activation with fewer side effects in comparison to synthetic drugs.

It also explores iceberg SAR signature variability over various ocean parameters. Three-dimensional (3-D) profiles of icebergs were captured in a field study off the coast of Bonavista, NL, Canada, in June 2017 at the time of an SAR satellite overpass. The 3-D profiles were captured from a vessel, using a LiDAR and multibeam sonar. The SAR image and 3-D profiles were captured within hours of one another. Simulated SAR images of the icebergs were generated in a simulator called GRECOSAR with the satellite, target orientation, and ocean parameters that closely mimic the real SAR scene. A new ocean model was introduced to model an ocean backscatter at satellites’ lower incidence angle beam mode. Comparison between real and simulated SAR images of the icebergs shows good agreement in terms of SAR signature, total radar cross section, and polarimetric decomposition. Wind direction was varied over 90° extent to observe icebergs’ backscatter variability in the simulator. Furthermore, simulated SAR images were generated for low and high wind conditions. Our study finds that the macrostructure of the melt iceberg dominates its polarimetric behavior of its backscatter. Large variability of iceberg SAR signature over varying ocean parameters was also observed. A mathematical model that considers the melting condition of iceberg suggested that significant backscattering can reflect from top surface when the melt water layer could be as little as 0.1 mm.',\n",

The emergence and subsequent evolution of small-scale magnetic features across the full solar surface is simulated, subject to the influence of a global supergranular flow pattern. Visually, the resulting simulated magnetograms reproduce the typical structure and scale observed in quiet Sun magnetograms. Quantitatively, the simulation quickly reaches a steady state, resulting in a mean field and flux distribution that are in good agreement with those determined from observations. A potential coronal magnetic field is extrapolated from the simulated full Sun magnetograms to consider the implications of such a quiet photospheric magnetic field on the corona and inner heliosphere. The bulk of the coronal magnetic field closes very low down, in short connections between small-scale features in the simulated magnetic network.

This paper considers the profoundly important and under-recognized role of structured judgments provided by technical specialists with local experience in relevant ecological and technological systems, in order to inform climate change adaptation choices, including ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA). It begins with a brief review of the concepts and methods for eliciting judgments from technical experts for complex decisions under uncertainty. Then, the case study is described: an expert judgment task to assess the performance of the recently approved watershed management plan for the Guacerique watershed near Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Several key variables including water yield in dry seasons, cost changes and also more broadly defined ecosystem service benefits, under two climate scenarios, are employed to consider performance. The results provide resource managers with information on how to maximize the adaptation potential of an already approved management plan. It shows that estimates of potential enhanced water flows in dry seasons could yield millions of dollars in annual benefits, based on current water prices paid to informal water suppliers, and depending on future climate scenarios. A broader implication of the study is to document a relatively accessible, cost-effective approach to support policy decisions related to EBA and infrastructure, which is relevant for decisions to help achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.',\n",
