To date, there has been no published research examining determinants of body image in this population of Black women. The authors hypothesized that ethnic identity and attachment to mother would predict body esteem in this population. One hundred twelve women (M age 39.3) were surveyed, and hierarchical regression analysis revealed that attachment to mother was a significant predictor of body esteem, especially with regard to physical condition and weight control. The findings from the current study suggest that the mother-daughter relationship remains influential in the development of positive body esteem over the life span.\",\n",

La plupart d’entre eux sont des gliomes diffus de la protuberance. Pendant longtemps, ces tumeurs etaient seulement diagnostiquees sur leur aspect tres typique en IRM, du a l’impossibilite d’une resection chirurgicale totale et le risque presume d’une biopsie, dans un contexte de lesion de tres mauvais pronostic. Depuis quelques annees plusieurs communications montrent la faisabilite des biopsies des lesions du tronc cerebral avec tres faibles risques d’aggravation neurologique. En plus, les avancees en diagnostic de biologie moleculaire permettraient de mieux cibler les traitements par chimiotherapie.       Materiel/methode   On a revu la totalite des patients de moins de 18 ans ayant beneficie d’une biopsie du tronc cerebral realisee entre 2009 a 2014 dans notre institution. Toutes les procedures ont ete realisees par ponction sous neuronavigation, guidee par robot ROSA® dans les jours qui ont suivi le diagnostic par IRM.       Resultats   On a inclus 7 patients sur 8 (patient exclu du a la realisation d’une biopsie sur recidive presumee d’ependymome connu) pour cette etude, 3 garcons et 4 filles. La variation d’âge de presentation etait entre 5 a 11 ans avec une moyenne d’âge de 7,57. La symptomatologie plus frequente de presentation etait l’alteration des nerfs crâniens suivie de troubles moteurs. Deux procedures ont ete realisees par voie trans-frontal et 5 par cerebelleuse (pedoncule cerebelleux moyen). La cible etait dans tous les cas la prise de contraste plus marque. Le resultat anatomopathologique a revele : 3 astrocytomes anaplasiques grade III OMS, 2 glioblastomes, 1 oligodendriogliome grade II OMS et 1 astrocytome diffus. Des analyses de biologie moleculaire ont ete realisees ensuite. Aucune complication operatoire n’a ete retrouvee, et seulement un cas de deficit moteur transitoire du membre superieur (voie frontal).       Conclusion   La biopsie des tumeurs du tronc cerebral par neuronavigation, guidee par robot, est une procedure avec faible risque de complication neurologique, techniquement simple et d’une grande precision diagnostique. Son adaptabilite a la population pediatrique constitue un pas fondamental dans la prise en charge multidisciplinaire des tumeurs infiltrantes du tronc cerebral.\",\n",

The objective of this study was to characterize the MMP-13 gene in channel catfish, and to determine its pattern of expression in various healthy tissues and during embryogenesis. Since MMP-13 has been shown to have importance in tissue remodelling and some pathological processes, we further studied its involvement in the defense responses of catfish after bacterial infection. The channel catfish MMP-13 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1416 bp encoding 471 amino acids. Using RT-PCR analysis, MMP-13 was widely expressed in various health tissues. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis, expression of MMP-13 gene was up-regulated by bacterial infection. During normal embryological development, MMP-13 expression was slightly increased in the first day post-fertilization and sharply up-regulated from 1-day post-fertilization through hatching.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Among the modes of transmission available to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) is sexual transmission, primarily via semen. Both male-to-female (M-F) and male-to-male (M-M) sexual transmission significantly contribute toward the spread of CMV infections in the global population. Semen plays an important role in carrying the viral particle that invades the vaginal or rectal mucosa, thereby initiating viral replication. Both semen and seminal plasma (SP) can enhance HIV-1 infection in cell culture, and two amyloid fibrils, semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI) and amyloids derived from the semenogelins (SEM amyloids), have been identified as seminal factors sufficient to enhance HIV-1 infection (J. Munch et al., Cell 131:1059-1071, 2007; N. R. Roan et al., Cell Host Microbe 10:541-550, 2011; F. Arnold et al., J. Virol. 86:1244-1249, 2012). Whether SP, SEVI, or SEM amyloids can enhance other viral infections has not been extensively examined. In this study, we found that SP, SEVI, and SEM amyloids strongly enhance both human CMV (HCMV) and murine CMV infection in cell culture. SEVI and SEM amyloids increased infection rates by >10-fold, as determined by both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Viral replication was increased by 50- to 100-fold. Moreover, viral growth curve assays showed that SP, SEVI, and SEM amyloids sped up the kinetics of CMV replication such that the virus reached its replicative peak more quickly. Finally, we discovered that SEM amyloids and SEVI counteracted the effect of anti-gH in protecting against CMV infection. Collectively, the data suggest that semen enhances CMV infection through interactions between semen amyloid fibrils and viral particles, and these interactions may prevent HCMV from being neutralized by anti-gH antibody.\",\n",

Using OLPLS, the ligand and protein descriptors could be connected to eight adenosine receptor inhibitor activities. The fingerprints representing specific chemical substructures on the ligands were used as the ligand descriptors, while z-scales were used as the protein descriptors. Three clusters were observed in the chemical and protein spaces from the predictive scores and loadings. From these, the predictive and orthogonal ligand structure fragments towards three adenosine receptors could be successfully elucidated. The predictive fragment for the human adenosine 2A receptor was confirmed by comparison to the X-ray crystal structure. As expected, the orthogonal fragments contained no physicochemical features required for specific interaction with the adenosine receptors.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Purpose: To explore the potential of beam angle optimization (BAO) for IMPT and compare fixed beamlines with gantries. Methods: For three patients with challenging intracranial lesions, we generate reference IMPT treatment plans applying three manually selected beam orientations and treatment plans applying three optimized beam orientations considering five scenarios: (1) patients are in supine position and the treatment room features (1.a) a horizontal beamline, (1.b) a horizontal, 45°, and vertical beamline, (1.c) a gantry, (2) patients are in supine or seated position and the treatment room features (2.a) a horizontal beamline, or (2.b) a horizontal, 45°, and vertical beamline. We use a genetic algorithm that considers up to 1,400 non‐coplanar candidate beams and evaluates 10,000 beam ensembles for one BAO. Beam orientations that may compromise the robustness of treatment plans are excluded before the optimization based on an objective measure of existing tissue heterogeneities. Results: The optimized beam ensembles exhibit certain similarities even though the sets of candidate beams differ significantly for the five scenarios. Compared to manually selected beam orientations, they provide improved OAR sparing and equivalent target coverage. Compared to one another, they yield comparable target conformity (deviations of the conformity number <1%), target homogeneity (standard deviations of the target dose <0.8 Gy), and sparing of OARs (deviations of average mean and maximum doses in OARs +/− 1 Gy). Using a gantry, however, the integral dose can be reduced by 5–15% compared to a horizontal beamline with patients in supine position. For the investigated cases comparable reductions can be achieved by also irradiating in seated position with a horizontal, 45°, and vertical beamline. Conclusions: BAO has the potential to provide beneficial IMPT treatment plans. Compared to fixed beamlines, gantries yield only modest effects regarding OAR sparing but may enable a significant reduction of integral dose for individual patients.\",\n",

The algorithm utilizes the box-counting measure of the fractal dimension to determine the number of hypercubes required to encompass the aggregate, on a set of length scales, over which the structure can be defined as fractal. At each length scale the hypercubes required to generate the structure are chosen using a simple random walk which ensures connectivity of the aggregate. The algorithm is highly efficient and overcomes the limitations on the magnitude of the fractal dimension encountered by previous techniques.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A simple catalytic system based on a soluble bismuth(III) salt, Bi(NO3)3/H2O2/HNO3/CH3CN + H2O, exhibits pronounced activity towards the homogeneous oxidation of inert alkanes with the yield of oxygenate products up to 32% and TON up to 112. The experimental selectivity parameters and kinetic data together with theoretical DFT calculations indicate that the reaction occurs via a free radical mechanism involving the formation of the HO˙ radicals which directly react with alkane molecules. The mechanism of the HO˙ generation (which is the rate limiting step of the whole process) includes the substitution of a water ligand for H2O2 in the initial aqua complex [Bi(H2O)8]3+, hydrolysis of the coordinated H2O2, second H2O-for-H2O2 substitution and the homolytic HO–OH bond cleavage in complex [Bi(H2O)4(H2O2)(OOH)]2+ (6). The relatively low overall activation energy for this process (ca. 20 kcal mol−1) is accounted for by the high lability and acidity of the Bi aqua complexes and tremendous activation of coordinated H2O2 in 6 towards homolysis.\",\n",

S is completely overlapped by P and as a consequence the overlapping region is subject to distinctive evolutionary constraints compared to the remainder of the genome. Specifically, a non-synonymous substitution in one coding frame may produce a synonymous substitution in the alternative frame, suggesting a possible conflict between requirements for diversifying and purifying forces. To examine how these contrasting requirements are balanced within this region, we investigated the relationship amongst positive selection sites, conserved regions, epitopes and elements of protein structure to consider how HBV balances the contrasting evolutionary pressures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMethodology/Results \\r\\n323 HBV genotype D genome sequences were collected and analyzed to identify sites under positive selection and highly conserved regions. Epitopes sequences were retrieved from previously published experimental studies stored in the Immune Epitope Database. Predicted secondary structures were used to investigate the association between structure and conservation. Entropy was used as a measure of conservation and bivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between positive selection/conserved sites and epitope/secondary structure regions. Our results indicate: (i) conservation in S is primarily dictated by α-helix elements in the protein structure, (ii) variable residues are mainly located in PreS, the major hydrophilic region (MHR) and the C-terminus, (iii) epitopes in S, which are directly targeted by the host immune system, are significantly associated with sites under positive selection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusions \\r\\nThe highly variable spacer domain in P, which corresponds to PreS in S, appears to act as a harbor for the accumulation of mutations that can provide flexibility for conformational changes and responding to immune pressure.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"THIS issue of Cytometry presents the third occasion on which a call has been issued to encourage authors to submit their work to the journal for publication as part of a special Congress Proceedings Issue of Cytometry. An incentive for submission was that accepted papers would be guaranteed an oral presentation at the XXVI ISAC Congress in Baltimore—CYTO 2011. The topics of the accepted papers range from proteomewide modeling to CD4 testing in resource-limited settings. The research articles do not speak to a given theme, rather they provide a snap-shot of the diversity of interest in cytometry with proffered examples of some of the latest trends in the field of cytometry. The Proceedings Issue of Cytometry also incorporates two reviews. The first review, by Darzynkiewicz et al., has been scheduled for publication in alignment with the conference, as it speaks to a topical area—‘‘click chemistry’’—an increasingly used conjugation and assembly technology with attendant advantages of biocompatibility, selectivity, and yield (1). The second review, presented at CYTO 2011, provides an update on cytometric challenges in veterinary andrology. In parallel with the discovery of the structure of DNA, 1953 also saw the publication of a study by Howard and Pelc (2) on the patterns of radiolabel incorporation by meristematic cells of Vicia faba. This landmark paper proposed the existence of a cell division cycle demarcated by preand postgaps for DNA synthesis. Their discovery set in process the widespread application of labeling methods for the analysis of the eukaryotic cell cycle, leading to the recognition of the universality of its major regulators (3) and exploitation in studies on anticancer drug-induced perturbations of cell cycle kinetics. In this issue, Darzynkiewicz et al. overview the Cytometry of DNA replication and RNA synthesis from its historical backdrop to recent advances based on ‘‘Click Chemistry.’’ The review covers fluorescence quenching methods, immunocytochemical detection through to the recent incorporation of EdU for the click chemistry detection of DNA damage via histone H2AX phosphorylation analyzed by flow or laser scanning cytometry. K.B. Sharpless, the 2001 Nobel Prize winner for Chemistry, introduced the concept of click chemistry for reactions that fulfill useful criteria including being modular and providing very high yields with favored physiologically stable, single reaction products (4). The concept drives applications for addition reaction conditions using preferred solvents and simple routes for product isolation— key issues for the cytometrist. Since the first reports of sexed sperm, flow technology efforts have been largely focused on improving sample throughput resulting in routine high-purity sorting of Xor Y-chromosome-bearing sperm (5). However, a more refined assessment of fertilizing potential of veterinary semen samples by flow cytometry has yet to exploit the full potential of the technology. Petrunkina and Harrison in Cambridge, UK have worked on the determinants of sperm quality and fertility in domestic species and recently provided an exact mathematical analysis of the systematic mis-estimation of semen-derived cell subpopulations by flow cytometry (6). The current review addresses cytometric solutions presenting recent developments, advantages and limitations together with the aspects of sperm physiology that could benefit from multicolor flow cytometric procedures. Advantageous biophotonic characteristics of molecular probes underpin many cytometric studies. The detection of lu-\",\n",
